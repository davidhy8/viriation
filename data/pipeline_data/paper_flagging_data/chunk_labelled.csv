0,"Severe Glutathione Deficiency, Oxidative Stress and Oxidant Damage in Adults Hospitalized with COVID-19: Implications for GlyNAC (Glycine and N-Acetylcysteine) SupplementationHumanity is battling a respiratory pandemic pneumonia named COVID-19 which has resulted in millions of hospitalizations and deaths.COVID-19 exacerbations occur in waves that continually challenge healthcare systems globally.Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand all mechanisms by which COVID-19 results in health deterioration to facilitate the development of protective strategies.Oxidative stress (OxS) is a harmful condition caused by excess reactive-oxygen species (ROS) and is normally neutralized by antioxidants among which Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant.GSH deficiency results in amplified OxS due to compromised antioxidant defenses.Because little is known about GSH or OxS in COVID-19 infection, we measured GSH, TBARS (a marker of OxS) and F2-isoprostane (marker of oxidant damage) concentrations in 60 adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19.Compared to uninfected controls, COVID-19 patients of all age groups had severe GSH deficiency, increased OxS and elevated oxidant damage which worsened with advancing age.These defects were also present in younger age groups, where they do not normally occur.Because GlyNAC (combination of glycine and N-acetylcysteine) supplementation has been shown in clinical trials to rapidly improve GSH deficiency, OxS and oxidant damage, GlyNAC supplementation has implications for combating these defects in COVID-19 infected patients and warrants urgent investigation.1.IntroductionSince 2019, the world has been in the grip of a pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes an inflammatory viral pneumonia called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Patients infected with COVID-19 can develop fever and respiratory symptoms and are often admitted to the hospital due to progressive dyspnea and systemic complications necessitating support measures ranging from supplemental oxygen to the need for mechanical ventilation and intensive care.The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with episodic global surges ('waves') associated with large numbers of patients seeking hospitalization which places huge strains on healthcare staff, overruns hospitals and severely challenges healthcare systems as was witnessed globally with the recent delta variant.",0,0
1,"Patients infected with COVID-19 can develop fever and respiratory symptoms and are often admitted to the hospital due to progressive dyspnea and systemic complications necessitating support measures ranging from supplemental oxygen to the need for mechanical ventilation and intensive care.The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with episodic global surges ('waves') associated with large numbers of patients seeking hospitalization which places huge strains on healthcare staff, overruns hospitals and severely challenges healthcare systems as was witnessed globally with the recent delta variant.The discovery and rollout of COVID-19 vaccines were expected to boost herd immunity to rein in the raging pandemic, but viral mutations, vaccine hesitancy and vaccine non-availability have led to the rise of new strains of SARS-Cov-2 sequentially named beta, delta, kappa, mu, and the recent South African Omicron strain which has led to much global fear and concern due to its rapid international spread and has been designated by the World Health Organization as a variant of concern.These newer strains appear to have variable vaccine resistance resulting in breakthrough infections even in vaccinated patients, and COVID-19 waves continue to surge even in heavily vaccinated countries as is currently occurring in the United Kingdom and the European Union.As a result, the global scientific and medical communities are urgently trying to prepare for and manage newer COVID-19 waves, as this cycle tends to repeat at periodic intervals.In a new development, a recent study reports new data from an analysis of 13638 patients (with and without COVID-19) which suggests that these patients have an increased risk of death in the following 12-months.While older adults (OA) > 65 years of age have a higher risk of hospitalization and death due to acute COVID-19 infection, this new study reports that post-COVID mortality in adults < 65 year of age is higher than those > 65 year of age.The underlying reasons for this increase in post-COVID mortality are currently unclear but unrelated to cardio-respiratory etiology and attributed to COVID-19 related biological and physiological stresses.Because COVID-19 is a highly dynamic and unpredictable disease it is urgently necessary to identify and target all mechanistic defects which may be associated with poor health in patients with acute COVID-19, and also in the post-COVID aftermath.Oxidative stress (OxS) is a harmful condition caused by excess accumulation of reactive oxygen species and is linked to lung disease, heart disease, neurological disorders, diabetic complications, liver and kidney diseases, and to the biology of the aging process.Under physiological conditions, OxS is neutralized by antioxidants among which glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant endogenous intracellular antioxidant.Conditions with the highest risk of complications (including mortality) as a result of COVID-19 infection include older age, diabetes and immunocompromised status, and all three conditions have in common a high risk of elevated OxS and GSH deficiency.",0,0
2,"Under physiological conditions, OxS is neutralized by antioxidants among which glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant endogenous intracellular antioxidant.Conditions with the highest risk of complications (including mortality) as a result of COVID-19 infection include older age, diabetes and immunocompromised status, and all three conditions have in common a high risk of elevated OxS and GSH deficiency.We have studied GSH deficiency and OxS in older humans, immunocompromised HIV patients and diabetic patients and have reported that correcting these defects with GlyNAC (combination of GSH precursor amino acids glycine, and cysteine provided as N-acetylcysteine) significantly improves multiple additional defects and boosts health.Although GSH deficiency is proposed as the most likely cause for serious manifestations and death in COVID-19, little is known of GSH adequacy, OxS, or oxidant damage in adults hospitalized with COVID-19.Therefore, we measured intracellular GSH concentrations and plasma OxS in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and report our findings here.2.Materials and Methods2.1.Study ApprovalAll subjects gave their informed consent for inclusion before they participated in the study.The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) at Baylor College of Medicine, and Harris Health System in Houston, TX, USA.2.2.ParticipantsA total of 60 participants (25 women, 35 men; age range 21-85 years), admitted with COVID-19 (based on a PCR diagnosis) admitted to Ben-Taub General Hospital in Houston, TX were recruited and results compared to 24 uninfected historical controls from our prior studies conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic (pre-2019).2.3.Study DetailsThe study involved a single blood draw at one time, collected within the first 24-h of admission, after which patients concluded their participation in the study.Clinical lab work (plasma liver profile, BUN, Creatinine, glucose, blood counts) was obtained from the hospital records on admission.2.4.Outcome Measures2.4.1.Glutathione Concentrations and Oxidative StressRBC (red-blood cell) glutathione concentrations were measured in duplicate using the liquid chromatography (Waters ACQUITY UPLC System).Briefly, after blood was centrifuged, and plasma removed, 500 muL of red-blood cells were mixed immediately with 500 muL of chilled, isotonic monobromobimane buffer solution.This was subjected to 3 freeze-thaw cycles with liquid nitrogen to lyse RBCs.After being vigorously vortex-mixed, the whole blood-MBB mixture was incubated in the dark for the development of the glutathione-MBB derivative.Proteins were then precipitated with ice-cold 20% perchloric acid, and the supernatant fluid was analyzed for glutathione using the UPLC.",0,0
3,"After being vigorously vortex-mixed, the whole blood-MBB mixture was incubated in the dark for the development of the glutathione-MBB derivative.Proteins were then precipitated with ice-cold 20% perchloric acid, and the supernatant fluid was analyzed for glutathione using the UPLC.To determine GSSG concentrations, the reducing agent dithiothreitol was added to convert RBC-GSSG to glutathione, and the sample was processed as described above to give concentrations of total-GSH.The GSSG concentrations were obtained by subtracting the glutathione value of the total GSH from the reduced GSH.Plasma markers of OxS (as Thiobarbituric acid reducing substances, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), and oxidant damage (as F2-isoprostanes, 8-Iso-Prostaglandin-F2a, Cell Biolabs Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) were measured using ELISA assays.2.4.2.Plasma BiochemistryLiver profile, creatinine, BUN, glucose and blood counts were obtained from the hospital admission records.2.5.Statistical MethodsBiomarker measures are summarized by means with standard deviations.Summary statistics are stratified by cohort (Controls vs. COVID-19).A multiple linear regression model estimated the mean (95% CI, confidence interval) response.A separate model is fit for each outcome measure.Models include fixed effects for cohort, age group, and sex as well as all two-way and three-way interaction terms.The models test 8 specific hypothesis tests per measure.p-values are adjusted for multiple hypothesis tests using the Bonferroni correction only within each model.Statistical significance is assessed at the two-sided 0.05 level.Model assumptions were assessed by residual analysis.3.Results3.1.AgeControls were 51.7 +- 20.2 years of age, and hospitalized COVID-19 patients were 51.0 +- 14.6 years of age.Study participants included (a) Young Adults (21-40 y) with COVID-19 (YA-C, N = 21) and uninfected Young Adults who served as controls (YA, N = 8); (b) Middle-Aged adults (41-60 year) with COVID-19 (MA-C, N = 21) and uninfected Middle-Aged adults who served as controls (MA, N = 8); (c) Older Adults (>60 year) in the COVID-19 group (OA-C, N = 18) and uninfected Older Adults as the control group (OA, N = 8).3.2.Plasma BiochemistryLaboratory results are shown in Table 1.3.3.",0,0

6,"This is an important discovery because younger humans are not expected to have GSH deficiency, but we found that patients in the 21-40 and the 41-60 year age groups had severe GSH deficiency compared to uninfected age-matched controls.OA with acutely infected with COVID-19 have the highest rates of hospitalization and mortality.In our study, we found that OA hospitalized with COVID-19 had the lowest GSH concentrations, with GSH levels lower than uninfected age-matched control OAs suggesting that when older humans are infected with COVID-19, their GSH levels decline even further.Collectively these data indicate that GSH deficiency is highly prevalent in patients admitted to hospitals due to COVID-19.In previous clinical trials in OA, diabetic patients and in HIV-infected patients, we found and reported that GSH deficiency occurs as a result of decreased intracellular synthesis (due to deficiency of GSH precursor amino acids glycine and cysteine).Although the reasons for GSH deficiency in hospitalized COVID-19 patients are unclear, it could well be the result of a combination of factors including decreased synthesis and increased GSH utilization.In our prior trials, we found that supplementing GlyNAC (combination of glycine and N-acetylcysteine, a cysteine donor) for a relatively short period of 14 days improves/corrects GSH deficiency in OA, HIV-patients and diabetic patients, and these data suggest the possibility that similar supplementation of GlyNAC in COVID-19 patients could improve GSH deficiency, and warrants investigation.The implications of GlyNAC supplementation in COVID-19 infection are discussed in a subsequent section below.4.2.Oxidative Stress and Oxidant Damage in COVID-19Oxidative stress (OxS) is a harmful condition associated with cellular toxicity and organ dysfunction due to oxidant induced damage.OxS contributes to dysfunction affecting the lungs, heart, brain, liver, muscle, pancreas, and to abnormalities, such as inflammation and vascular dysfunction which are commonly present in COVID-19 and other conditions including aging, diabetes, HIV, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease and more.Therefore, the findings of this study that COVID-19 is associated with excessively elevated OxS and evidence of oxidant damage are important, as they could contribute to COVID-19 related injury and mortality.Targeting OxS and oxidant damage effectively could be key in improving health and survival in COVID-19 infected patients.OxS originates from the accumulation of excess reactive oxygen species which are formed in mitochondria during the process of energy generation.Cells usually depend on antioxidants for protection from OxS and oxidant damage, and GSH is the most abundant intracellular antioxidant.Therefore, GSH deficiency can amplify the destructive potential of OxS due to compromised antioxidant defenses.In uninfected humans, OxS tends to occur mainly in older humans (>60 year of age) and not in younger age groups.",0,0
7,"Therefore, GSH deficiency can amplify the destructive potential of OxS due to compromised antioxidant defenses.In uninfected humans, OxS tends to occur mainly in older humans (>60 year of age) and not in younger age groups.Indeed, the 'free radical theory of aging' was proposed in 1956 to suggest that elevated OxS in older humans could be responsible for the aging process.Therefore, the observation in this study that COVID-19 infected patients in the young (21-40 year) and middle-aged (41-60 year) groups have severely elevated OxS and oxidant damage is important, as they could help explain the health deterioration associated with COVID-19 resulting in hospitalization and death.This is especially relevant in light of the recent COVID-19 surge with the delta variant which disproportionately affected younger humans, and that the <65 year age group has a higher rate of mortality in the 12-months following COVID-19 infection.Certain populations are associated with a higher prevalence of elevated OxS (such as OA, immunocompromised HIV-infected patients and diabetic patients) and COVID-19 infection in such patients could result in a catastrophic increase in OxS resulting in health deterioration and is a probable reason why these groups are exceptionally vulnerable to adverse outcomes related to acute COVID-19 infection.In clinical trials in these populations of OA, HIV-patients and diabetic patients, we studied and reported that supplementing GlyNAC provides powerful, biologically relevant cellular protection from the harmful and toxic effects of OxS, without the risk of reductive stress.Therefore, it is likely that GlyNAC supplementation could play an important role in combating OxS and oxidant damage toward protecting cellular health in COVID-19 patients and is discussed next.4.3.Potential Benefits of GlyNAC Supplementation in COVID-19Could GlyNAC supplementation have health benefits for patients with COVID-19?Older age, immunocompromised status (such as HIV infection) and diabetes are among pre-existing conditions most vulnerable to the ravages of COVID-19.In published clinical trials in OA, HIV-infected patients and diabetic patients, we reported that GlyNAC supplementation for 2-weeks rapidly improves GSH deficiency, OxS, and damage caused by OxS, and longer durations of supplementation correct these defects.A computational analysis of therapeutic targets and discovery of potential drugs against SARS-Cov-2 identified GSH as a key potential candidate.",0,0
8,"In published clinical trials in OA, HIV-infected patients and diabetic patients, we reported that GlyNAC supplementation for 2-weeks rapidly improves GSH deficiency, OxS, and damage caused by OxS, and longer durations of supplementation correct these defects.A computational analysis of therapeutic targets and discovery of potential drugs against SARS-Cov-2 identified GSH as a key potential candidate.GSH has been reported to inhibit replication of the influenza virus (which causes a viral respiratory pneumonia with a high annual mortality rate in OA), and we speculate that if boosting GSH can inhibit replication of the SARS-Cov-2 virus which causes COVID-19, this could be a gamechanger in the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.A small case study reported that increasing GSH levels improved dyspnea in 2 patients infected with COVID-19, and NAC supplementation is reported to have a beneficial impact in ventilated COVID-19 patients.However, the use of antioxidant supplements in COVID-19 should be used with caution due to the risk of inducing reductive stress, a condition excess lowering of reactive oxygen species can cause harm.In multiple clinical trials, we have shown that GlyNAC successfully lowers OxS, without triggering reductive stress.Additional benefits of GlyNAC supplementation comes from its ability to provide the vitally important amino-acids glycine and cysteine.Glycine is a 1-carbon metabolite and a methyl-group donor which is necessary for DNA synthesis, cellular reactions, brain, cartilage and cellular health.Indeed, methyl-group deficiency has been proposed as a potential mechanism for COVID-related complications.Cysteine (from NAC) is critically important for supporting mitochondrial energy metabolism and donates a sulfhydryl group which is necessary for multiple cellular reactions and biosynthesis of metabolites.By virtue of its ability to provide glycine and cysteine and GSH, GlyNAC is referred to as representing a 'power of three'.The benefits of GlyNAC supplementation go well beyond correcting GSH deficiency and OxS as it also improves inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, endothelial vascular dysfunction, insulin resistance, genotoxicity, autophagy/mitophagy and muscle strength as reported in human clinical trials.This is relevant because similar defects are also reported in patients with COVID-19.Overall, the combination of the findings of this study, and the observations on the potential benefits of GlyNAC supplementation in prior clinical trials suggest a potentially beneficial role for GlyNAC supplementation in COVID-19 infected patients and supports the need for research studies to evaluate the impact of GlyNAC supplementation in COVID-19.4.4.Study LimitationsThe limitation of this study is that blood was collected one single time within 24 h of admission, and results should be interpreted with that caveat.Future studies are needed to determine whether GSH deficiency and OxS worsen during the course of hospitalization, and to establish a temporal scale on recovery (or lack of recovery) of these outcomes over several months post-discharge from the hospital.",0,0

14,"mRNA vaccination compared to infection elicits an IgG-predominant response with greater SARS-CoV-2 specificity and similar decrease in variant spike recognitionDuring the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, new vaccine strategies including lipid nanoparticle delivery of antigen encoding RNA have been deployed globally.The BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein shows 95% efficacy in preventing disease, but it is unclear how the antibody responses to vaccination differ from those generated by infection.Here we compare the magnitude and breadth of antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, and endemic coronaviruses, in vaccinees and infected patients.We find that vaccination differs from infection in the dominance of IgG over IgM and IgA responses, with IgG reaching levels similar to those of severely ill COVID-19 patients and shows decreased breadth of the antibody response targeting endemic coronaviruses.Viral variants of concern from B.1.1.7 to P.1 to B.1.351 form a remarkably consistent hierarchy of progressively decreasing antibody recognition by both vaccinees and infected patients exposed to Wuhan-Hu-1 antigens.IntroductionIn 2020, following decades of research to develop messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, and accelerated by the urgent need for countermeasures against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the U.S. FDA authorized two mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna/NIAID).mRNA vaccines are a promising alternative to conventional vaccine approaches in part because a relatively consistent biomolecule can be used to generate a variety of antigens in the vaccine recipient.They have been shown to stimulate protective immune responses to viral infections in pre-clinical models, and recently have demonstrated high efficacy and safety in clinical trials for COVID-19 prevention.mRNA vaccines mimic some aspects of viral infection by using the host cell’s translational machinery to transiently express properly folded vaccine antigens in situ, driving strong humoral and T cell responses.It remains to be determined precisely how the immune system responds to RNA vaccines and their other components such as lipid nanoparticles, compared to other vaccine platforms or infection.Immune correlates of protection from COVID-19 have not been fully elucidated, but both humoral and cellular responses may contribute to preventing and containing infection.",0,1

30,"A lipidomic view of SARS-CoV-2AbstractThe global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which started in late 2019, has caused huge social and economic losses.A growing number of investigators are focusing on understanding the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with host cellular processes to find therapeutic approaches.New data suggest that lipid metabolism may play a significant role in regulating the response of immune cells like macrophages to viral infection, thereby affecting the outcome of the disease.Therefore, understanding the role of lipid metabolism could help develop new therapeutic approaches to mitigate the social and economic cost of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Viral infections are a growing threat to human health and the economy, highlighting the need to understand their interaction with the host.The emergence of COVID-19 has accelerated this need.A growing number of investigators are working to understand how the causative agent of this disease n,amely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) i,nteracts with the human during infection.After the virus enters the respiratory tract, the first barrier for viral entry to the host cells (epithelial cells) is the mucus, which consists of heavily glycosylated mucins and healthy bacteria.In silico studies predict that proteins or natural products (NPs) produced by these bacteria can bind to the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, interfering with viral entry to the host cells.This interference is because the virus uses its spike glycoprotein to invade and infect host cells.Specifically, the proteolytic activity of the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) induces conformational changes in the closed state of the spike glycoprotein leading to the formation of an open state, in which the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein is exposed.Subsequently, the RBD binds to the host-cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry to the cells and infection.ACE2 receptor is present in several organs, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, and the gastrointestinal tract.After entry to the cell, the virus hijacks host cellular machinery to reproduce, and at the same time, the host immune system is activated to limit replication of the virus.Lipids play a central role in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2, which is an envelope virus surrounded by a lipid bilayer, and in the immune response.",0,0
31,"After entry to the cell, the virus hijacks host cellular machinery to reproduce, and at the same time, the host immune system is activated to limit replication of the virus.Lipids play a central role in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2, which is an envelope virus surrounded by a lipid bilayer, and in the immune response.In the host cells, lipid droplets (LDs) are involved in different steps of the viral replication process, for example, by acting as a platform for the replication of viral genomic material.The LDs formation is induced in innate immune cells (such as macrophages) to support the host immune response.The formation of LDs requires triglycerides (TGs) and phosphatidylcholine (PC).In authentic macrophages, the endogenous biosynthesis of these metabolites can be stimulated through inhibition of the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) by the antiviral enzyme RSAD2 (also known as viperin).Additionally, free cholesterol (FC) and phospholipids (PLs) efflux of macrophages in response to the blood levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and lipid-free apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) in the blood contributes to systemic lipid homeostasis.However, how the regulation of cellular lipid metabolism is translated into the changes observed in systemic lipid homeostasis (blood levels of different types of lipids, HDL, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and ApoA1) during viral infection is not yet understood (Figure 1).The link between cellular lipid metabolism and systemic lipid homeostasis is not clearSARS-CoV-2 infects host cells and hijacks lipid metabolism for replication.In the innate immune cells like macrophages synthesis of TGs are induced and these cells secrete TGs, cholesterol, and PLs in response to the blood levels of HDL and ApoA1.How these changes at the cellular level are translated to the systemic lipid metabolism and blood levels of TGs, FC, PLs, HDL, VLDL, and ApoA1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection is not clear.While SARS-CoV-2 does not cause severe disease in many individuals, in those above 65 years, the excess death overwhelming increases to ~94%.Besides aging, other risk factors (Figure 2) that could determine the severity of the infection by SARS-CoV-2 include metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes, and imbalances in the population of commensal microbiota, which are at the interface of host metabolism and immune response.Therefore, a better understanding of how and why COVID-19 has such a massive impact among aged populations and those with other risk factors will help develop new therapeutic approaches and improve current treatments.Aging and other risk factors of COVID-19 are associated with metabolic changes affecting the function of the immune system.A common metabolic feature of the conditions related to these risk factors is dysfunction in lipid metabolism (Figure 2).",0,0
32,"Aging and other risk factors of COVID-19 are associated with metabolic changes affecting the function of the immune system.A common metabolic feature of the conditions related to these risk factors is dysfunction in lipid metabolism (Figure 2).Firstly, some metabolic products of gut microbiota like L-lactate regulate lipid metabolism in enterocytes.The low bacterial richness can lead to a decrease in the levels of HDL and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C).Secondly, the capacity of various tissues, particularly skeletal muscle, to oxidize fat decreases with age.This decrease may be the reason for increased production and accumulation of VLDL and some TGs.Aging also remodels HDL.Specifically, the antioxidant activity of HDL from the elderly is reduced, and these defective HDLs are rapidly taken up by macrophages.Thirdly, many studies have shown altered lipid metabolism in diabetes patients.For example, in insulin resistance individuals with Type 2 diabetes (T2D), the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is reduced leading to a decrease in plasma HDL-C and an increase in TGs and accumulation of VLDL.Finally, several studies show that the levels of HDL and HDL-C are significantly lower in individuals characterized as obese.Thus, it appears that a common feature of the risk factors of COVID-19 is low levels of or dysfunctional HDL.The ability of HDL to dampen inflammatory signals in diabetes patients is reduced, and HDL can induce eicosanoid production to modulate the immune response.Immune cells like macrophages show a change in lipid metabolism upon activation, and lipids such as eicosanoids produced by the immune cells play an essential role in regulating the immune response to pathogens.These studies suggest that an imbalance in HDL production or function and lipid metabolism could contribute to the dysfunction of the immune system and the severity of COVID-19 disease.Recent studies support this proposal: (i) dysregulation of eicosanoids, lipids produced by the innate immune cells, and a shift in serum lipids are shown to be linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection, (ii) lipidomic studies of COVID-19 patients have revealed a positive direct correlation between lower HDL and severity and mortality rate of the disease, and (iii) dysregulation of lipid metabolism is correlated with pathological inflammation and severity of the COVID-19 disease.Dysregulation of lipid metabolism links the risk factors of COVID-19 disease to the dysfunction of immune cells like macrophagesDifferent risk factors of COVID-19 such as imbalance in commensal microbiota, metabolic disorders like diabetes and obesity, and aging are characterized by dysregulation of lipid metabolism.",0,0

34,"ApoA1 interacts with ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1), mediating FC and PLs efflux forming pre-beta-HDL.HDL2 and HDL3 are two subfractions of HDL, and PL-rich spherical HDL2 is the ideal lipoprotein for scavenger receptor class B1 (SR-BI)-mediated cholesterol efflux.Interestingly the blood level of FC in COVID-19 survivors is significantly higher than that in non-survivors.Collectively, based on the available data, we propose a mechanistic model linking cellular lipid metabolism to systemic lipid homeostasis affecting the outcome of COVID-19 disease (Figure 3).Specifically, in individuals with no or minor liver damage (Figure 3A), there is a continuous efflux of TGs, FC, and PLs.These lipids are consumed for HDL biosynthesis.TG-rich HDL3 enhances the formation of HDL and HDL-mediate FC and PLs efflux, which regulates the response of macrophages.Cholesterol (FC) efflux induces pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses of macrophages.Damage to the liver could abolish its function in producing TGs, VLDL, and HDL (Figure 3B).As a result, consumption of TGs for regulation of HDL also decreases.Meantime, the efflux of FC and PLs continues, but their consumption for the biosynthesis of HDL reduces.Therefore, FC and PLs accumulate.This imbalance in systemic lipid homeostasis causes an uncontrolled immune response decreasing the survival rate.This model is consistent with reports showing that disruption of cholesterol biosynthesis by COVID-19 causes an imbalanced immune response and 'cytokine storm' leading to pulmonary damage.The cause of damage to the liver can be a viral infection of this organ, which expresses the ACE2 receptor, or independent of viral infection via other factors such as diet.For example, in mice, high sucrose levels can cause hepatic steatosis, which is the accumulation of lipids in the liver.In the long term, the condition can lead to an advanced form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.The postulated model linking cellular lipid metabolism to systemic lipid homeostasis and the outcomes of COVID-19 disease(A) When HDL level is sufficient, TGs, FC, and PLs produced by immune cells are consumed.Therefore, their blood levels are balanced leading to a controlled immune response and positive outcome.Enrichment of HDL3 with TGs enhances HDL conversion: fusion of two HDL3 by enzymatic activity of PLTP and formation of HDL2 with concomitant release of ApoA1.HDL2 is taken up by liver, and HDL2 and ApoA1 stimulate cholesterol efflux in macrophages.This response has both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects.Thus, HDL regulates macrophage function to induce a controlled immune response increasing the survival rate of COVID-19 patients.",0,0
35,"This response has both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects.Thus, HDL regulates macrophage function to induce a controlled immune response increasing the survival rate of COVID-19 patients.(B) When there is not a sufficient level of HDL, which could be caused by severe liver damage or other factors, or when HDL is defective, e.g.due to aging, TGs, FC, and PE are produced by immune cells but are not consumed.This results in an uncontrolled immune response and negative outcome for patients.Both in (A,B) the change in level of TGs is the result of the net difference between efflux/production and consumption.Thus, in both (A,B) the level of TGs could increase.It is possible that the types of TGs involved in (A) are different than those involved in (B).In summary, the study by Bai and colleagues and other recent reports provide evidence in support of the model outlined in Figure 3, which links cellular lipid metabolism and systemic lipid homeostasis to the survival rates of COVID-19 patients.To further elucidates the model's validity, many fundamental questions related to lipid metabolism must be addressed.For example, which specific type of TGs or subfraction of HDL was most significantly modulated in patients who made a full recovery compared with those who did not?How does the lipid composition of HDL change during the process of infection and recovery?Which type of TGs and/or lipids are associated with macrophage function?The untargeted LC-MS approach developed by Bai and colleagues is a valuable tool to help in investigating the role of lipids in immune response and macrophage function before, during, and after treatment of COVID-19 patients.Such studies are likely to provide new insight into the importance of the specific type of lipids and lipid metabolism for a controlled and effective immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.We predict that the outcomes of these studies will provide a better understanding of the role of lipid metabolism in viral infection and therefore support the development of new therapeutic approaches to mitigate the ongoing social and economic cost caused by the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2.Competing InterestsThe authors declare that there are no competing interests associated with the manuscript.FundingThis work was supported by the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) [grant number EMBO ALTF 157-2015 (to K.H.E.)]; the COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) Action CA15133 [grant number ECOST-STSM-Request-CA15133-44200 (to K.H.E.)]; and the CRUK Oxford [grant number CRUKDF - 0221 (to K.H.E.",0,0

37,"Therapeutic effect of simultaneous intravitreal dexamethasone and aflibercept on diabetic macular edemaAimsTo report the effect of simultaneous intravitreal dexamethasone (DEX) and aflibercept for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME).MethodsThis retrospective analysis of an open-label, multicenter, consecutive case series included 102 eyes of 81 patients with DME.Patients were selected into two groups.The control group consisted of 50 eyes treated with aflibercept alone, and the combination group consisted of 52 eyes treated with simultaneous DEX implant and aflibercept injection.The primary endpoints were changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) from baseline to month 6.The secondary endpoint was the interval of retreatment.ResultsBaseline BCVA increased and CRT decreased at 6 months in both groups.Pseudophakic eyes in the combination group exhibited significantly greater BCVA improvement compared with phakic eyes (p = 0.031).Fewer intravitreal treatments were required for eyes treated with combination therapy than for those treated with aflibercept alone (1.56 +- 0.54 vs. 4.04 +- 1.26, p < .0001), with a mean retreatment interval of 3.66 +- 0.69 months.ConclusionsSimultaneous intravitreal DEX and aflibercept achieved non-inferior improvement of visual and anatomic outcomes compared with aflibercept alone for DME, but exhibited a significantly longer treatment interval and superior visual outcome in pseudophakic eyes.This therapeutic approach is considered a valid strategy for treating DME in the era of COVID-19.IntroductionThe number of people diagnosed as having diabetes mellitus globally is estimated to grow to 700 million by the year 2045.In this population, diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of visual loss, mainly as a result of the development of diabetic macular edema (DME).Therefore, managing DME and to reducing its treatment burden is crucial for retina specialists.Numerous studies have demonstrated the benefit of treating DME with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections for improving visual acuity and reducing retinal thickening.However, one limitation of this therapy is the frequent injections required to maintain efficacy.Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had a major impact on healthcare systems around the world.Diabetic patients are considered at high risk for COVID-19 complications and should not be exposed to avoidable risks, including the frequent injections procedures.",0,0
38,"Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had a major impact on healthcare systems around the world.Diabetic patients are considered at high risk for COVID-19 complications and should not be exposed to avoidable risks, including the frequent injections procedures.Furthermore, large clinical trials have indicated that only 33-45% of patients with DME on anti-VEGF agents exhibit three lines or more of visual improvement on the Snellen chart.The partial response to anti-VEGF agents is thought to be a result of the multifactorial etiology of DME.In addition to anti-VEGF agents, intravitreal corticosteroids, such as the dexamethasone (DEX) intravitreal implant 0.7 mg (Ozurdex, Allergan, Irvine, CA, USA), have been demonstrated to be effective in treating DME.Thus, the combination of steroids and anti-VEGF agents may have synergistic effects in the treatment of DME because of their different pathophysiological targets.However, no widely accepted guidelines regarding combination therapy are available, and studies have provided only limited evidence for the use of licensed intravitreal anti-VEGF agent injections in combination with intravitreal steroid implants.In this study, we compared the functional and anatomical outcomes of simultaneous intravitreal DEX and aflibercept versus an aflibercept monotherapy to treat patients with DME.MethodsThis was a multicenter study comprising five study sites.Institutional review board (IRB) approval was obtained through the individual IRBs at the participating institutes.This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.Medical records of patients with a diagnosis of DME were reviewed for the period from January 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021.The inclusion criteria were as follow: (1) being aged 18 years or older; (2) having type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus; (3) having DME causing visual loss, with a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) with Snellen equivalent of 20/400 to 20/40; and (4) having macular edema defined both clinically and by a central retinal thickness (CRT) of > 300 mum, measured using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT).The exclusion criteria were patients with (1) concomitant ocular disease that could cause macular edema and (2) a known history of glaucoma or past corticosteroid response.Patients who received anti-VEGF agents injection (within 3 months), panretinal laser photocoagulation (within 6 months) or focal/grid laser photocoagulation (within 3 months) before study entry were considered non-treatment naive.A total of 81 patients with DME, and 102 eyes were selected into two groups.The control group consisted of 50 eyes treated with aflibercept alone, and the combination group consisted of 52 eyes treated with simultaneous DEX implant and aflibercept injection.",0,0

46,"The increased IOP associated with the DEX implant was usually controlled with medication.Similarly, in our study, 15.4% of eyes were managed with topical anti-glaucomatous medications, and 17.4% underwent cataract surgery.Nevertheless, steroid-related cataracts generally appear in the second year after steroid therapy, and cataract extraction is usually performed on three DEX implant-treated eyes.Therefore, the rate of cataract surgery in our patients is likely to increase later in the follow-up period.Despite the short-term study period, our results did not reveal a significantly higher rate of adverse effects compared with other studies when using DEX plus aflibercept as the primary treatment for DME.We recognize some limitations of our analysis, including its short-term follow-up period and small sample size, which may have compromised the data analysis.The study period was insufficient to evaluate differences in cataract extraction, and no standardized measurement of cataract development was performed.Therefore, a longer follow-up period is required to understand the long-term benefit of simultaneous DEX implant and aflibercept injection in the treatment of DME.In conclusion, the ideal treatment approach for DME should achieve the following goals: improved BCVA, improved morphological changes in the macula maintained for a considerable duration, reduced adverse events, reduced treatment burden and costs, and increased treatment tolerance by patients.Our study demonstrated that the application of simultaneous intravitreal DEX and aflibercept treatments achieved all the aforementioned goals and resulted in greater BCVA improvement in pseudophakic eyes than in phakic eyes.Furthermore, fewer patients in the combination group required macular laser therapy during the study period.Less or no energy laser applications may lead to a reduction in collateral damage and preservation of long-term visual function.This therapeutic approach showed limited adverse effect during the study period, and exhibited a significantly longer treatment interval which is considered a valid strategy in the era of COVID-19.This article belongs to the topical collection Eye Complications of Diabetes, managed by Giuseppe QuerquesPublisher's NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.FundingThis study was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) (MOST 109-2314-B-075-029, and Taipei Veterans General Hospital (V110C-185).DeclarationsConflict of interestThe author(s) have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.Ethical approvalThis was a multicenter study comprising five study sites.Institutional review board (IRB) approval was obtained through the individual IRBs at the participating institutes.This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.Informed consentAll participaints gave their informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study.",0,0
