0,0,0,"Recurrent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 spike deletion H69/V70 and its role in the Alpha variant B.1.1.7SummaryWe report severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike ΔH69/V70 in multiple independent lineages, often occurring after acquisition of receptor binding motif replacements such as N439K and Y453F, known to increase binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor and confer antibody escape.In vitro, we show that, although ΔH69/V70 itself is not an antibody evasion mechanism, it increases infectivity associated with enhanced incorporation of cleaved spike into virions.ΔH69/V70 is able to partially rescue infectivity of spike proteins that have acquired N439K and Y453F escape mutations by increased spike incorporation.In addition, replacement of the H69 and V70 residues in the Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike (where ΔH69/V70 occurs naturally) impairs spike incorporation and entry efficiency of the B.1.1.7 spike pseudotyped virus.Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster kinetics of cell-cell fusion than wild-type Wuhan-1 D614G, dependent on ΔH69/V70.Therefore, as ΔH69/V70 compensates for immune escape mutations that impair infectivity, continued surveillance for deletions with functional effects is warranted.Graphical abstractHighlightsSpike ΔH69/V70 does not confer escape from antibodiesSpike ΔH69/V70 increases cleaved S2 and spike infectivityB.1.1.7 requires ΔH69/V70 for efficient cleaved spike incorporation and infectivityB.1.1.7 spike requires ΔH69/V70 for rapid syncytium formationMeng et al.report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike ΔH69/V70 has arisen multiple times.The deletion increases entry efficiency associated with increased cleaved spike in virions and can compensate for loss of infectivity.The B.1.1.7 spike requires ΔH69/V70 for efficient cell entry and cell-cell fusion activity.IntroductionSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike surface glycoprotein engagement of human angiotensin-converting enzyme (hACE2) is essential for virus entry and infection, and the receptor is found in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.",1,0,1
1,1,1,"The deletion increases entry efficiency associated with increased cleaved spike in virions and can compensate for loss of infectivity.The B.1.1.7 spike requires ΔH69/V70 for efficient cell entry and cell-cell fusion activity.IntroductionSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike surface glycoprotein engagement of human angiotensin-converting enzyme (hACE2) is essential for virus entry and infection, and the receptor is found in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.Despite this critical interaction and the imposed constraints, it appears that the receptor binding domain (RBD) is relatively tolerant to mutations, raising the real possibility of virus escape from past infection or vaccine-induced immunity and monoclonal antibody treatments.Spike mutants exhibiting reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies have been identified in in vitro screens, and some of these mutations have been found in clinical isolates.Studying chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection can give insights into virus evolution that would require many chains of acute transmission to generate.This is because the majority of infections arise as a result of early transmission during pre- or asymptomatic phases prior to peak adaptive responses, and virus adaptation is not observed because the virus is usually cleared by the immune response.We recently documented de novo emergence of antibody evasion mutations mediated by spike gene mutations in an individual treated with convalescent plasma (CP).In addition, a chronically infected immune-suppressed individual has been reported recently in Russia with emergence of Y453F along with ΔH69/V70.Deletions in other parts of the N-terminal domain (NTD) have been reported to arise in chronic infection and reduce sensitivity to NTD-specific neutralizing antibodies.Here we analyze global SARS-CoV-2 data and find that ΔH69/V70 occurs independently, often emerging after a significant RBD amino acid replacement, such as Y453F and N439K, which are known to facilitate neutralizing antibody escape or alter ACE2 binding while incurring an infectivity defect, according to some reports.Although structural modeling indicates that H69/V70 is in an exposed loop that contracts after deletion, potentially altering an antigenic site, we report that the ΔH69/V70 does not confer significantly reduced susceptibility to convalescent sera or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).Functionally, we find that ΔH69/V70 does increase spike infectivity and compensates for an infectivity defect resulting from the RBD replacements N439K and Y453F.The infectivity increase is driven by higher levels of spike incorporation into virions.We demonstrate that the deletion is required for optimal infectivity of the 501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7) spike protein.We show that, although B.1.1.7 and the wild-type (WT) spike pseudotyped virus (PV) have similar infectivity on a range of target cell types, the B.1.1.7 spike protein alone induces more rapid cell-cell fusion and formation of multinucleated cells.",1,1,1

B.1.1.7 appeared to mediate more cell-cell fusion events over earlier time points, with the color overlap area being 2–3 times greater for B.1.1.7 compared with the WT 6 h after mixing.Interestingly, this enhancement was abrogated by re-insertion of the H69 and V70 residues (Figures 7B–7D).We conclude that B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster fusion kinetics than the WT bearing D614G Wuhan-1 spike that is dependent on ΔH69/V70.ΔH69/V70 does not enhance infectivity of bat coronavirus RaTG13 spikeFinally, to investigate the importance of this part of spike beyond SARS-CoV-2 for other coronaviruses with zoonotic potential, we examined the 69/70 region of spike in a set of other known sarbecoviruses (Figures S4A–S4C).",1,14,1

5,16,16,"This independent occurrence of the insertion is suggestive of context-dependent selective pressure playing a role in recurring gain and loss of these two residues in sarbecoviruses.To test whether the fitness effect associated with acquisition of ΔH69/V70 is specific to SARS-CoV-2 and not other sarbecovirus spike backgrounds, we cloned FL S from RaTG13 and generated pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing RaTG13 spike protein as well as a RaTG13 S ΔH69/V70 counterpart.We observed that cleaved and uncleaved S expression levels in the PV did not differ between WT and the ΔH69/V70 RaTG13 spike and that there was no difference in infectivity on target cells expressing ACE2 or ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Figures S4D and S4E).This result suggests that, as one would expect, the enhancing effect of ΔH69/V70 on spike levels and infectivity is specific to the spike background.DiscussionWe have presented data demonstrating multiple independent and circulating lineages of SARS-CoV-2 variants bearing spike ΔH69/V70.This recurring deletion, spanning 6 nt, is due to an out-of-frame deletion of 6 nt and occurs in the terminal loop of a helix loop motif within the predicted RNA structure, as do other NTD deletions observed in new variants, such as B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617 (Delta), B.1.351 (Beta), and P.1 (Gamma) (Figure S5).Stable helix loop motifs are associated with pausing/dissociation events in reverse transcriptase.Because all nucleic acid polymerases have a common ancestor with homologous dinucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) binding motifs and similar global structures, it is probable that all RNA polymerases use similar mechanisms for transcript termination.A recent in-cell biochemical analysis of SARS-CoV2 RNA structure showed nucleotide reactivity consistent with this model within these stem-loops.These analyses provide a rationale for preferential emergence of ΔH69/V70 and other deletions, such as the well-described NTD antibody escape deletion ΔY144 (in B.1.1.7 and the recently reported B.1.525) at the terminal loops of helical loop motifs.ΔH69/V70 itself has frequently followed immune escape-associated amino acid replacements in the RBD (e.g., N439K and Y453F) and is specifically found in the B.1.1.7 variant, known to have higher transmissibility and, possibly, pathogenicity.We find that ΔH69/V70 does not significantly reduce the sensitivity of spike to neutralizing antibodies in serum from a group of recovered individuals or binding of multiple mAbs directed against the NTD.In addition, we have shown that repair of ΔH69/V70 does not appreciably alter the potency of NTD antibodies against the B.1.1.7 spike.Thus, the deletion is unlikely to be an immune escape mechanism.",1,16,1
6,17,17,"In addition, we have shown that repair of ΔH69/V70 does not appreciably alter the potency of NTD antibodies against the B.1.1.7 spike.Thus, the deletion is unlikely to be an immune escape mechanism.Instead, our experimental results demonstrate that ΔH69/V70 is able increase infectivity of the Wuhan-1 D614G spike PV as well as the PV bearing the additional RBD mutations N439K or Y453F, explaining why the deletion is often observed after these immune escape mutations that carry infectivity cost.We show that the mechanism of enhanced infectivity across the RBD mutations tested is associated with greater spike incorporation into virions where ΔH69/V70 is present.The phenotype is also independent of producer cells used.Importantly, we were able to recapitulate the ΔH69/V70 phenotype in a spike protein that did not have the D614G mutation, indicating that D614G is not involved in the mechanism.These observations are supported by ΔH69/V70 being observed in D614 viruses in January 2020 in the United States and Thailand.Although we did not use a replication-competent system, a recent study reports that the ΔH69/V70 mutated Washington strain virus isolate confers increased replication in cell lines and higher viral loads in hamsters.Indeed, ΔH69 has been observed in cell culture during remdesivir selection experiments with a replication-competent virus, consistent with a replication advantage.We have found consistent differences in spike as well as cleaved spike in the producer cell and its incorporation into PV particles when comparing ΔH69/V70 with a Wuhan-1 spike (both with D614G).This could be explained by stability during intracellular trafficking or the route taken to the surface, differences in post-translational modification of the spike protein, or membrane characteristics at the budding site of virus or virus-like particles.Because the amount of spike incorporation into virions reflects the spike in the cells, virion formation is likely unaffected by ΔH69/V70.Interestingly, although pharmacological inhibition of furin by CMK in producer cells did prevent S1/S2 cleavage and altered the balance of S2:FL spike in cells and virions, PV infectivity was not reduced by drug treatment.These data suggest that the increase in entry efficiency conferred by spike ΔH69/V70 is independent of spike S1/S2 cleavage.Similar findings regarding the lack of relationship between the balance of S2:FL and infectivity have been reported in the context of furin knockout cells rather than furin inhibition with CMK.In addition, a recent report on the S1/S2 cleavage site mutation P681H demonstrated that enhanced cleavage of spike P681H was not associated with increased PV infectivity or cell fusion relative to the WT.",1,17,1
7,18,18,"Similar findings regarding the lack of relationship between the balance of S2:FL and infectivity have been reported in the context of furin knockout cells rather than furin inhibition with CMK.In addition, a recent report on the S1/S2 cleavage site mutation P681H demonstrated that enhanced cleavage of spike P681H was not associated with increased PV infectivity or cell fusion relative to the WT.There may, however, be differences in vivo.We explored the entry route of ΔH69/V70 spike using cathepsin inhibition to block endosomal entry and camostat to block entry via plasma membrane fusion.ΔH69/V70 spike was as sensitive to camostat and the cathepsin inhibitor ED64 as the WT, arguing that the efficiency of entry route is similar despite differences in cleaved spike.Although S1/S2 cleavage allows avoidance of endosome-associated IFITM restriction and appears to be critical for transmission in animal models, cleaved spike may be less infectious when S1 is shed prematurely, possibly conferring a disadvantage under some circumstances.In addition, showed that S1/S2 cleavage in the producer cell, conferred by a polybasic stretch at the cleavage site, is advantageous in cells expressing abundant TMPRSS2 but deleterious in cells lacking TMPRSS2.The Alpha variant Al (B.1.1.7), bearing seven spike mutations, is responsible for a new pandemic phase that is demonstrably more pathogenic and more transmissible.Detection of a high number of novel mutations suggests that this lineage has been introduced from a geographic region with very poor sampling or that viral evolution may have occurred in a single individual in the context of chronic infection.We show that Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike has similar infectivity as WT D614G spike, consistent with data on live B.1.1.7 virus in human airway epithelial cells but in contrast to another study that showed a difference in live virus with the 8 spike mutations.Importantly, however, we demonstrate loss of infectivity when the H69/V70 amino acids are replaced in B.1.1.7 S, accompanied, as expected, by reduced S1/S2 cleavage and reduced S incorporation into virions.These data point to epistatic interactions between observed mutations in spike of B.1.1.7 with a trade-off between mutations that incur virus entry cost with those that contribute to other activities, such as immune evasion.Of greatest potential importance is our observation that Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster syncytium formation and that this enhanced cell-cell fusion activity is dependent on ΔH69/V70.Syncytium formation is a key feature of severe and fatal COVID-19 and implicated in elevated viral replication.",1,18,1

2,35,35,"SARS-CoV-2 infection in the mouse olfactory systemSARS-CoV-2 infection causes a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in humans, and olfactory dysfunction is one of the most predictive and common symptoms in COVID-19 patients.However, the underlying mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to olfactory disorders remains elusive.Herein, we demonstrate that intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 induces robust viral replication in the olfactory epithelium (OE), not the olfactory bulb (OB), resulting in transient olfactory dysfunction in humanized ACE2 (hACE2) mice.The sustentacular cells and Bowman's gland cells in the OE were identified as the major target cells of SARS-CoV-2 before invasion into olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs).Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers massive cell death and immune cell infiltration and directly impairs the uniformity of the OE structure.Combined transcriptomic and quantitative proteomic analyses revealed the induction of antiviral and inflammatory responses, as well as the downregulation of olfactory receptor (OR) genes in the OE from the infected animals.Overall, our mouse model recapitulates olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients and provides critical clues for understanding the physiological basis for extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19.IntroductionThe emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to a global crisis.The clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection predominantly involve the respiratory system, including cough, sore throat, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).As the disease continues to spread widely, a significant portion of COVID-19 patients are developing anosmia, hyposmia, or other olfactory dysfunctions according to clinical reports.Accumulated evidence has established the alteration of smell as one of the most predictive symptoms for COVID-19 screening.The perception of smell begins with odorant binding to the olfactory receptors (ORs) of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) along the upper surface of the olfactory epithelium (OE).Each OSN projects an axon into the glomerulus of the olfactory bulb (OB) and then synapses with second-order neurons to convey odour information to the olfactory cortex.Previously, upper respiratory tract infections were considered a common cause of olfactory disorders.Mouse models have been used to reproduce olfactory system infection and subsequent olfactory dysfunction.",0,1,0
3,36,36,"Previously, upper respiratory tract infections were considered a common cause of olfactory disorders.Mouse models have been used to reproduce olfactory system infection and subsequent olfactory dysfunction.For example, post viral olfactory disorders were observed in Sendai virus-infected mice by the buried food pellet test (BFPT), as well as the impairment of OE and OB tissues.However, an animal model that can recapitulate the olfactory dysfunctions seen in COVID-19 patients remains lacking.Human nasal respiratory epithelium (RE) cells exhibit high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2.Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses have characterized the expression profile of ACE2 in the OE of mice and humans, mainly in non-neuroepithelial cells, and in a recent study based on a hamster model, many SARS-CoV-2-infected cells were observed in the OE section.In addition, vascular pericytes in the OB exhibited a high level of ACE2 expression in a mouse model; these cells play a key role in the maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, as well as the regulation of blood pressure and the host immune response.Interestingly, some respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus, are able to invade the OB and other parts of the brain to establish infection.Thus, how SARS-CoV-2 invades the olfactory system and contributes to the observed central nervous system (CNS) diseases remains to be determined.In the present study, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection directly causes transient olfactory dysfunction in an established mouse model and characterize the major target cells and pathological effects that contribute to olfactory dysfunction.ResultsSARS-CoV-2 targets the OE and causes transient olfactory dysfunction in hACE2 miceSARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the OE and causes olfactory dysfunction in hACE2 mice.a Schematic diagram of the experimental design.Briefly, groups of 6-8-week-old hACE2 mice were infected with 5.4 x 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 intranasally.The olfactory function of infected mice was measured by the buried food pellet test at the indicated times post inoculation.Mice were sacrificed at 2 dpi and 4 dpi for viral detection and histopathological analysis.b Schematic view of the OM in the nasal cavity of mice in a sagittal plane.The dotted line indicates a coronal section (upper).Viral genomic RNA (gRNA, middle) and subgenomic RNA (sgRNA, lower) copies were determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and are shown as means +- SD from three independent replicates.",0,2,0

5,38,38,"Additionally, high levels of viral subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) (2.24 x 108 RNA copies/mouse), indicating the presence of actively replicating virus, were detected in the OM at 2 dpi, and subsequently decreased at 4 dpi (9.89 x 106 RNA copies/mouse); however, the sgRNA levels in the OB and brain were below the detection threshold (Fig.1b).As expected, in situ hybridization (ISH) by RNAscope demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was predominantly detected in OE (Supplementary Fig.S2a) but not in the OB (Supplementary Fig.S2b).Furthermore, an immunofluorescence staining assay detected high levels of SARS-CoV-2 N protein expression in the OE along the OM at 2 dpi (Fig.1c), and only marginal expression of viral protein was observed at 8 dpi (Supplementary Fig.S3).However, we did not detect SARS-CoV-2 N protein-positive cells in the OB or other parts of the brain at 2 dpi and 4 dpi (Supplementary Fig.S2c).To examine whether SARS-CoV-2 infection directly impairs the olfactory function of infected mice, a standard BFPT was conducted at 2 and 4 dpi.Remarkably, a significantly increased latency (152.8 s vs 81.8 s; P = 0.022) to locate food pellets was observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice compared with the control animals at 2 dpi (Fig.1d).Of particular note, 2 out of the 13 infected mice developed severe symptoms of anosmia, as they failed to locate the food pellet within the observation period.Interestingly, recovery of infected mice from olfactory dysfunction was observed at 4 dpi, as the latency to locate food pellets was not different from that of the control animals (67.1 s vs 70.2 s; P = 0.992).Thus, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the OE and leads to transient olfactory dysfunction in mice.SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets non-neuroepithelial cells in the OE of hACE2 miceThe OM consists of the OE and the underlying lamina propria (LP).The OE is composed of olfactory stem/progenitor cells, including the horizontal basal cells (HBCs) and globose basal cells (GBCs) residing in the basal region, mature and immature OSNs, and a variety of non-neuroepithelial lineages, including the sustentacular cells, microvillar cells, and Bowman's gland cells.The OSNs lining under the supporting cells project numerous dendritic cilia with ORs into the nasal cavity and intermingle with the microvilli of sustentacular cells and microvillar cells (Supplementary Fig.S4a).Due to the asymmetrical expression pattern of ACE2 on the cell membrane as well as the unique organization of the OE, it is not easy to determine which cell compartments express ACE2.",0,4,0
6,39,39,"S4a).Due to the asymmetrical expression pattern of ACE2 on the cell membrane as well as the unique organization of the OE, it is not easy to determine which cell compartments express ACE2.To overcome this, we took advantage of the tdTomato cassette downstream of the hACE2 transgene with an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which allows the detection of hACE2 expression by cytoplasmic fluorescence of tdTomato (Supplementary Fig.S4b).Abundant expression of hACE2 along the apical surface of the OE and within the underlying LP was detected with a human ACE2-specific monoclonal antibody, exhibiting a similar expression pattern as tdTomato (Supplementary Fig.S4c).A detailed characterization of hACE2/tdTomato-expressing cells in the OM revealed that non-neuroepithelial cells, including sustentacular cells (CK8 positive, Supplementary Fig.S4d, d1), the duct and acinus of Bowman's gland cells (Sox9/CK8 positive, Supplementary Fig.S4d, d2, d4) in the OE and LP, respectively, and microvillar cells (CD73/CK8 positive, Supplementary Fig.S4e), are the primary cell types that exhibit human ACE2 expression (Supplementary Fig.S4d, f), whereas little hACE2/tdTomato expression was detected in the neuroepithelial lineages, including HBCs (CK5 positive), GBCs (Sox2 positive in the basal region), immature olfactory sensory neurons (iOSNs) (GAP43 positive), and mature olfactory sensory neurons (mOSNs) (OMP positive) (Supplementary Fig.S4d, d1-d4).SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets non-neuroepithelial cells in the OE.a Representative multiplex immunofluorescent staining assay showing that SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 N protein positive) infects sustentacular cells (CK8 positive, yellow arrows), Bowman's gland cells (Sox9/CK8 positive, white arrows), microvillar cells (CD73/CK8 positive, cyan arrows), HBCs (CK5 positive, gold arrows), and iOSNs (GAP43 positive, green arrows) at 2 dpi.Little SARS-CoV-2 N protein was detected within OMP-positive mOSNs.b Statistical analysis of the percentage of each cell compartment within SARS-CoV-2-positive cells.The data are presented as means +- SD (n = 3).c Multiplex immunofluorescent staining results showing an OM sample at 4 dpi with SARS-CoV-2 detected in the OMP-positive mOSNs and the underlying nerve bundles.The framed areas labeled c1 and c2 are shown adjacently at larger magnifications.",0,5,0

0,44,44,"4b).We did not find any obvious induction of antiviral response-related genes in OB samples by transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, but downregulation of inflammatory response-related genes was observed (Supplementary Fig.S9a, b).Of particular note, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of downregulated transcripts and proteins in the OE showed that genes belonging to ""olfactory transduction"" were significantly enriched (Fig.4c).Among all 100 downregulated transcripts at 2 dpi, 36 encoded ORs (Fig.4d and Supplementary Fig.S6b), while among the 278 downregulated transcripts at 4 dpi, 97 encoded ORs (Supplementary Figs.S6b and S8d).Further qRT-PCR assays showed that 13 representative OR genes were significantly downregulated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig.4e), which may also be attributed to the observed olfactory dysfunction.We further analyzed the expression of other host cell factors that were reported to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cells.The results showed that Nrp1 was significantly downregulated at 2 dpi (Supplementary Fig.S10a), and slight downregulation of Bsg/CD147, Tmprss2, Furin, and Tfrc/transferrin receptor was also detected by RNA-seq analyses (Supplementary Fig.S10b-e).DiscussionIn the present study, we used an established mouse model to demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause olfactory dysfunction and anosmia, and this experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection is the cause of olfactory dysfunction and anosmia in COVID-19 patients.SARS-CoV-2-infected mice exhibited a damaged OE, immune cell infiltration, downregulated OR expression, and impaired olfactory function, largely mimicking the olfactory abnormalities of COVID-19 patients.Robust viral replication and direct antiviral responses were detected in the OE of the infected mice but not in the OB and other parts of the brain, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 mainly infected the OM in the hACE2 mouse model.A recent study also showed that the SARS-CoV-2 protein could be detected in the OE, but not in the OB, in a hamster model.One possible explanation for the absence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS is that virus infection and replication in OE can effectively activate IFN-dependent antiviral responses (Supplementary Fig.S7a, b), which is an effective barrier that prevents viral invasion into the CNS.In addition, the apoptosis of infected OSNs may contribute to the prevention of viral spread into the CNS after the rapid infection and destruction of the OE.Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 invaded brain tissues in K18-hACE2 mice, which expressed hACE2 under the cytokeratin 18 promoter.",0,10,0
1,45,45,"In addition, the apoptosis of infected OSNs may contribute to the prevention of viral spread into the CNS after the rapid infection and destruction of the OE.Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 invaded brain tissues in K18-hACE2 mice, which expressed hACE2 under the cytokeratin 18 promoter.These inconsistencies in SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes, including CNS tropism, in different mouse models may be attributed to the different expression profiles of human ACE2 as well as the experimental systems.Our results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 initially infects non-neuroepithelial cells, including sustentacular cells, Bowman's gland cells and microvillar cells, which are involved in OSN support, host immune response, electrolyte balance maintenance, and mucus secretion.Moreover, we observed various levels of damage in the OE after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including cilia desquamation, loss of surface microvilli, and substantial structural disorganization.In addition, our results showed a certain degree of cell apoptosis and inflammatory infiltration at both the cell and molecular levels following SARS-CoV-2 infection.All these data indicate that the damaged supporting non-neuroepithelial cells and inflammatory infiltration caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection contribute to the detrimental effects of the virus on olfactory function.Our results are supported by recent findings in mice and humans, showing that the non-neuroepithelial cells of the OE express high levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 at both the mRNA and protein levels.Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2-positive signals were also observed in HBCs and mOSNs of infected animals at 2 dpi and 4 dpi, respectively (Fig.2a, c), although we did not detect any hACE2 expression in these cells (Supplementary Fig.S4d).The underlying mechanism remains elusive, and an hACE2-independent route of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be considered.According to recent studies, some other host cell receptors were found to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection, including NRP1, CD147, and transferrin receptor.Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 contains a specific furin cleavage site in the spike protein and utilizes TMPRSS2 for further spike protein priming.In our study, we found that the Nrp1, Bsg/CD147, Tmprss2, Furin, and Tfrc/transferrin receptor were downregulated to varying degrees in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice at 2 dpi, as shown by RNA-seq analyses, but whether these proteins play critical roles in olfactory dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 infection in our animal model remains unknown and warrants extensive investigation.We observed that many ORs were significantly downregulated at 2 and 4 dpi, suggesting the occurrence of decreased olfaction after SARS-CoV-2 infection.",0,11,0
2,46,46,"Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 contains a specific furin cleavage site in the spike protein and utilizes TMPRSS2 for further spike protein priming.In our study, we found that the Nrp1, Bsg/CD147, Tmprss2, Furin, and Tfrc/transferrin receptor were downregulated to varying degrees in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice at 2 dpi, as shown by RNA-seq analyses, but whether these proteins play critical roles in olfactory dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 infection in our animal model remains unknown and warrants extensive investigation.We observed that many ORs were significantly downregulated at 2 and 4 dpi, suggesting the occurrence of decreased olfaction after SARS-CoV-2 infection.A recent study also showed that induction of antiviral type I interferon signaling in the mouse OE was associated with diminished odour discrimination and decreased RNA levels of ORs.These findings may support what we observed in this study: SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a significant interferon response and dramatic OR decrease simultaneously in the OE.We also observed that the levels of three odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), which are compact globular water-soluble proteins with ligand-binding capabilities and are thought to aid in the capture and transport of odorants to the ORs, significantly decreased at the protein level with OE infection.In addition, although no viral infection was observed in the OB, we detected some up/downregulated transcripts or proteins by transcriptomic and proteomic analyses.Notably, among all four proteins co-regulated at both the transcriptomic and proteomic levels, Rtp1 (receptor-transporting protein 1) was downregulated at both levels (Supplementary Table S1).This protein specifically promotes functional cell surface expression of ORs, suggesting that the inhibition of Rtp1 in OB may lead to downregulation of ORs.Therefore, OE damage, which is closely related to olfactory dysfunction, is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection of non-neuroepithelial cells and OSNs synergizes with the host antiviral immune responses.According to our results, the olfactory dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals was recoverable, as almost all animals recovered their normal sense of smell at 4 dpi.Additionally, studies focusing on COVID-19 patients with anosmia have shown that most of them recover from loss of smell within a few weeks or less, and only a small number of patients reported slow partial recovery over 1 to 3 months, indicating a potential mechanism of OE regeneration from injuries.The hACE2 mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection reproduces the clinical course and viral replication observed in COVID-19 patients, as it mimics the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the transient olfactory dysfunction observed in human individuals.The difference in the time span of viral infection and clearance between humans and mice reflected the inherent differences between the species.The OE undergoes lifelong regeneration and replacement depending on two populations of basal stem cells, namely, HBCs and GBCs.HBCs are mitotically quiescent under normal conditions and become activated and differentiate into other kinds of cells once OE damage occurs.Unlike HBCs, most GBCs are mitotically activated and are responsible for the regeneration of both neuronal and non-neuronal cells.",0,12,0
3,47,47,"HBCs are mitotically quiescent under normal conditions and become activated and differentiate into other kinds of cells once OE damage occurs.Unlike HBCs, most GBCs are mitotically activated and are responsible for the regeneration of both neuronal and non-neuronal cells.Indeed, we observed regeneration of the OE, as indicated by the significant proliferation and morphological change of HBCs, accompanied by the differentiation of stem cells into iOSNs, sustentacular cells and microvillar cells.In this way, the structural basis and function of the OE as well as olfactory function can be restored to normal in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals.Furthermore, it was indicated that the damage and apoptosis of OSNs are closely involved in their regeneration, and the occurrence of an inflammatory response also facilitates stem cell differentiation and OE regeneration.At the transcriptomic and proteomic levels, we observed upregulated ""regulation of neuron projection development"" genes/proteins at 2 and 4 dpi, implying the progression of a neuron projection over time from its formation to the mature structure.Interestingly, although there were many significantly downregulated ORs at 4 dpi, the mRNA levels of many ORs increased slightly compared with those at 2 dpi, indicating that OR expression tends to recover to normal levels.In summary, our study established a mouse model of olfactory dysfunction induced by SARS-CoV-2.Considering the interspecies discrepancy in olfactory construction between rodents and humans, e.g., the relative size of the OB to the brain, the proportion of the brain involved in olfaction, and the expression of ORs, further studies are recommended to reproduce SARS-CoV-2-induced olfactory dysfunction in other animal models, especially nonhuman primates.Additionally, validating the targets and biological effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human specimens should still be considered.An animal model of olfactory disorders is available to subsequently evaluate antiviral drugs as well as vaccines for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 and for the improvement of post viral olfactory disorders.Materials and MethodsCell and virusVero cells were maintained at 37  C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 10 mM HEPES, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.The SARS-CoV-2 strain BetaCoV/Beijing/IMEBJ05/2020 (No.GWHACBB01000000) was originally isolated from a COVID-19 patient.For virus propagation, Vero cells were incubated with SARS-CoV-2, and the culture supernatants were collected at 3 dpi.The stock of SARS-CoV-2 was serially diluted and titrated on monolayers of Vero cells.",0,13,0

6,81,81,"Furthermore, even after reopenings occurred, SARS-CoV-2 incidence remained low, suggesting that high vaccine coverage might provide a sustainable path towards resuming normal activity.These data provide nationwide evidence of the beneficial public health impact of a COVID-19 vaccination campaign.During the study period, 95% of 8472 tested specimens showed an SGTF, associated with SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7, thereby providing evidence that BNT162b2 is effective against B.1.1.7.These findings are consistent with laboratory studies that indicated that BNT162b2 was likely to be effective against B.1.1.7.Notably, another clinically important variant, B.1.351, which was initially identified in South Africa, has recently been identified in Israel.Vaccine effectiveness against B.1.351, however, could not be estimated in our study because of the small number of B.1.351 infections identified in Israel during the study period.This study also suggests that two doses of BNT162b2 are effective against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections (with vaccine effectiveness estimates of 92% at ≥7 days after the second dose and 94% at ≥14 after the second dose).Estimates of effectiveness against asymptomatic infections were slightly lower than those against COVID-19, which could suggest a higher threshold of protection for asymptomatic infection compared with symptomatic illness.We conservatively defined asymptomatic infections as SARS-CoV-2 infections in interviewees who reported no fever and no respiratory symptoms at the time of the interview.Additionally, it is possible that some SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals who reported being asymptomatic at the time of interview might have instead been presymptomatic (ie, developed symptoms later).Although we made efforts to avoid this type of misclassification by excluding the small number of people who were initially reported to be asymptomatic but were later hospitalised for or died from COVID-19, some presymptomatic individuals who later developed symptoms without being hospitalised or dying might still have been included.This type of misclassification, however, was probably uncommon and would be unlikely to substantially influence the vaccine effectiveness estimate against asymptomatic infection.Notably, Israel's SARS-CoV-2 testing policy was different for unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals during the study period.At 7 days after the second dose, vaccinated individuals were exempt from the SARS-CoV-2 testing required of individuals who either had contact with a laboratory-confirmed case or returned from travel abroad.This testing policy might have resulted in a differential bias that would cause overestimation of vaccine effectiveness against asymptomatic infection (ie, asymptomatic people who received two doses were less likely to be tested than unvaccinated asymptomatic people).However, 19% of the 4·4 million PCR tests conducted during the study period were done on exempted individuals (MoH, unpublished data).Additionally, symptomatic individuals might have been reluctant to report symptoms for fear of being blamed for infecting other individuals, in which case asymptomatic vaccine effectiveness would also be overestimated.",0,17,1
7,82,82,"However, 19% of the 4·4 million PCR tests conducted during the study period were done on exempted individuals (MoH, unpublished data).Additionally, symptomatic individuals might have been reluctant to report symptoms for fear of being blamed for infecting other individuals, in which case asymptomatic vaccine effectiveness would also be overestimated.Conversely, individuals who were hesitant to receive a COVID-19 vaccine might also have been reluctant to seek SARS-CoV-2 testing, which would lead to underestimation of vaccine effectiveness against asymptomatic infection.Further studies are needed to confirm the magnitude of BNT162b2 protection against asymptomatic infection that we observed.Specifically, studies are needed to evaluate testing behaviour of vaccinated and unvaccinated people and to determine the extent to which prevention of asymptomatic infection leads to interruption of transmission.Two-dose BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness estimates from this observational study align with the 95% efficacy against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections shown in the pivotal RCT.Our study adds important new data about the effectiveness of BNT162b2 derived from outside of the RCT setting.We found high vaccine effectiveness against a wider range of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes (including severe COVID-19 and deaths) than were evaluated in the RCT, as well as high effectiveness in older adults with a level of precision not available in the RCT.In addition, although pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals were excluded from the RCT, these groups were recommended to receive BNT162b2 in Israel and an unknown number would, therefore, have been vaccinated.Finally, unlike the clinical trial, our study provides evidence that achieving high population-level coverage with BNT162b2 can lead to marked declines in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 outcomes.In the primary analysis of the Israel MoH surveillance data, we evaluated the effectiveness of two doses of BNT162b2, given Israel's adherence to the authorised two-dose 21-day vaccine schedule.In the sensitivity analysis, we showed moderate effectiveness of the vaccine against all SARS-CoV-2 outcomes at 14–21 days after the first dose.This finding is similar to those of studies from Israel early in the vaccine campaign and in the UK.Estimated effectiveness against all outcomes at 14–21 days after the first dose was lower than that of two doses at 7 days or longer or at 14 days or longer after the second dose, demonstrating the importance of fully vaccinating adults.Furthermore, despite indications of at least partial effectiveness after one dose of BNT162b2, relying on protection against COVID-19 from a single dose might not be prudent; BNT162b2 was developed and evaluated in the RCT as a two-dose schedule, and substantially lower levels of neutralising antibodies were observed after one dose compared with after two doses.",0,18,1

1,86,86,"Relative Mutant N501Y SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein RBD Inhibition of Anti-Spike Protein IgG and ACE-2 Binding to Spike Protein SpeciesThe coronavirus disease outbreak of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a newly emerging coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected more than 110 million people worldwide, resulting in more than 2.4 million deaths (500,000 in the U.S.), little more than 1 year after initial cases appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.It has now become apparent that neutralizing antibodies specific for the viral spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), which binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor on host cells, comprise the critical element of protective immunity to the virus (2).This contention is supported by the finding that the RBD is immunodominant and the target of 90% of the neutralizing activity present in SARS-CoV-2 immune sera (3).The BNT162b2 mRNA and mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, both coding for the spike glycoprotein, developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, respectively, elicit antibodies specific for the RBD and exhibit approximately 95% protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection (4-6).Several mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains have raised concerns regarding increased transmissibility, lethality, and escape from extant immunity, relative to the predominant pandemic strain, D614G, itself a mutant that arose soon after viral spread from Wuhan, China.Most notable of these mutant strains are B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1, which arose in the U.K., South Africa and Brazil, respectively, during late 2020 to early 2021(7-11).The South African variant is of concern, with 21 mutations, including 3 in the RBD, since it has been shown to exhibit reduced neutralization titers, not only against therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, but also COVID-19 convalescent and post-vaccination plasma samples (10-13).Recently, it has been confirmed that these reductions of neutralizing antibody function were sufficient to impair vaccine efficacy appreciably (14).Common to all of the three major variant strains is the RBD mutation N501Y, which signifies a substitution of L-tyrosine for L-asparagine at residue 501 of the spike protein.",1,1,1

8,93,93,"Characterization of entry pathways, species-specific ACE2 residues determining entry, and antibody neutralization evasion of Omicron BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3 variantsSince the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) with enhanced transmissibility, ACE2 binding affinity and immune evasive properties have emerged, including the most recent Omicron VOCs.Currently, Omicron (B.1.1.529) is comprised of five main lineages designated BA.1 (and its sublineage BA.1.1), BA.2 (and its sublineage BA.2.12.1), BA.3, BA.4, and BA.5.BA.1 was first identified in November 2021 in Botswana, and it rapidly replaced the then dominant Delta (B.1.617.2) VOC to become globally prevalent due to its enhanced transmissibility and ability to evade antibody neutralization 1–6.By early 2022, an alarming rise of BA.2 was seen in several parts of the world, leading to the replacement of BA.1 and BA.1.1.In comparison to BA.1, BA.2 was demonstrated to have faster replication kinetics, enhanced fusogenicity, and greater pathogenicity in hamsters 7,8.BA.4 and BA.5 are two new lineages that are presently emerging in South Africa.The spike protein of Omicron variants bears an unprecedented degree of antigenic divergence with the highest number of substitutions compared to ancestral B.1 (Wuhan-Hu-1, and D614G) variants and earlier VOCs.",1,1,1

4,99,99,"Conversely, ACE2 receptors of all species, except horseshoe bat, supported infection by Omicron pseudoviruses (Figure 5B-E).293T cells with stable expression of human ACE2 (293T.ACE2) were used as a positive control.We confirmed robust ACE2 expression for each species via Western blotting using the V5 tag at the C-terminus of these ACE2 proteins (Supplementary Figure 1).The Omicron pseudoviruses had significantly higher levels of infection than D614G pseudoviruses in cells expressing African green monkey, Chinese rufous horseshoe bat, ferret, mouse, Chinese hamster, Syrian golden hamster, white-tailed deer (save BA.1), swine, and bovine ACE2 receptors (Table 1).No significant difference between D614G and Omicron variants was observed with respect to Malayan pangolin ACE2 (Table 1).These findings indicate that the receptor binding motif (RBM) substitutions in the Omicron (BA.1, BA.2, BA.3 and BA.1.1) variants can modulate ACE2 receptor usage and therefore, Omicron variants’ entry.We next investigated the residues in D614G and Omicron spikes that allow or prevent infection of cells expressing horseshoe bat and mouse ACE2, respectively.Crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complexes show the ACE2 N-terminal helix cradled in the ridged concave surface formed by the spike RBM 43–46.Seventeen RBM residues contact ACE2 residues in its N terminus (Table 2).Among wild type SARS-CoV-2 RBM residues, Q498 interacts with D38, Y41, Q42, L45, and K353 residues of ACE2, while Q493 interacts with K31, H34, and E35 of ACE2, forming a network of hydrogen bonds 43–46.Structural and computational determination of Omicron RBD-ACE2 interactions revealed Q493R forming a new salt bridge with E35 while disrupting previous interactions of Q493 with K31 observed in wild type.The Q498R substitution also forms a new hydrogen bond and a salt bridge with ACE2 D38 and Q42 47–49.We assessed whether Q493R and Q498R substitutions in the RBM of Omicron spike facilitate entry of Omicron pseudoviruses in cells expressing mouse ACE2, or conversely, confer resistance to entry of cells expressing horseshoe bat ACE2.Pseudoviruses bearing Q493R and Q498R substitutions on the D614G background spike were therefore generated to infect 293T cells expressing ACE2 proteins of all the species described above.",1,7,1
