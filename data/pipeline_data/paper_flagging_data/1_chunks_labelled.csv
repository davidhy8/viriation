11,11,"RBD mutations reduced infectivity of spike relative to the WT by around 2-fold (Figure 5D) and was partially rescued by ΔH69/V70.Based on observations of the effect of ΔH69/V70 on spike incorporation in the WT (Figure 3D), we predicted that the mechanism of increased infectivity for ΔH69/V70 in the context of RBD mutations might be similar.Analysis of virions from cell supernatants and cell lysates indeed showed an increased ratio of spike:p24 (Figures 5E and 5F).As observed for the WT, we also observed increased cleaved S2:FL when ΔH69/V70 was present along with the RBD mutants in PVs (Figures 5E and 5G).ΔH69/V70 is required for optimal B.1.1.7 Alpha variant spike S2 incorporation and infectivitySpike ΔH69/V70 in B.1.1.7 enhances spike infectivity(A) Surface representation of the spike homotrimer in open conformation with one upright RBD overlaid with ribbon representation (PDB: 6ZGG), with different monomers shown in black, pale blue, and gold.The deleted residues H69 and V70 and the residues involved in amino acid substitutions (501, 570, 716, 982, and 1118) and the deletion at position 144 are colored red on each monomer and labeled on the monomer with an upright RBD shown in black.Scissors mark the approximate location of an exposed loop (residues 677–688) containing the furin cleavage site and including residue 681, which is absent from the structure.(B) Representative infectivity of B.1.1.7 with replacement of H69 and V70 versus B.1.1.7 containing spike ΔH69/V70 and WT (D614G) spike; single-round infection by luciferase-expressing lentiviruses pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on HeLa cells transduced with ACE2.The data represent technical triplicates.(C) Fold change of luciferase expression over the replacement of H69V70 in ACE2-transfected and ACE2- and TMPRSS2-transfected HEK293T cells, A459-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells, and H1299 cells.The data shown are from three independent experiments, each in technical triplicates (one-sample t test).(D) Representative western blot analysis following transfection of HEK293T cells with spike and lentiviral plasmids.Virion loading was normalized for input virus using RT activity.Antibodies against HIV-1 p24 and spike S2 were used with anti-GAPDH as a loading control.(E and F) S2 to FL spike was analyzed by densitometry, and the S2:FL cleavage ratio was calculated for virions (E) and cell lysates (F).",1,11

B.1.1.7 appeared to mediate more cell-cell fusion events over earlier time points, with the color overlap area being 2–3 times greater for B.1.1.7 compared with the WT 6 h after mixing.Interestingly, this enhancement was abrogated by re-insertion of the H69 and V70 residues (Figures 7B–7D).We conclude that B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster fusion kinetics than the WT bearing D614G Wuhan-1 spike that is dependent on ΔH69/V70.ΔH69/V70 does not enhance infectivity of bat coronavirus RaTG13 spikeFinally, to investigate the importance of this part of spike beyond SARS-CoV-2 for other coronaviruses with zoonotic potential, we examined the 69/70 region of spike in a set of other known sarbecoviruses (Figures S4A–S4C).",1,14

16,16,"This independent occurrence of the insertion is suggestive of context-dependent selective pressure playing a role in recurring gain and loss of these two residues in sarbecoviruses.To test whether the fitness effect associated with acquisition of ΔH69/V70 is specific to SARS-CoV-2 and not other sarbecovirus spike backgrounds, we cloned FL S from RaTG13 and generated pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing RaTG13 spike protein as well as a RaTG13 S ΔH69/V70 counterpart.We observed that cleaved and uncleaved S expression levels in the PV did not differ between WT and the ΔH69/V70 RaTG13 spike and that there was no difference in infectivity on target cells expressing ACE2 or ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Figures S4D and S4E).This result suggests that, as one would expect, the enhancing effect of ΔH69/V70 on spike levels and infectivity is specific to the spike background.DiscussionWe have presented data demonstrating multiple independent and circulating lineages of SARS-CoV-2 variants bearing spike ΔH69/V70.This recurring deletion, spanning 6 nt, is due to an out-of-frame deletion of 6 nt and occurs in the terminal loop of a helix loop motif within the predicted RNA structure, as do other NTD deletions observed in new variants, such as B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617 (Delta), B.1.351 (Beta), and P.1 (Gamma) (Figure S5).Stable helix loop motifs are associated with pausing/dissociation events in reverse transcriptase.Because all nucleic acid polymerases have a common ancestor with homologous dinucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) binding motifs and similar global structures, it is probable that all RNA polymerases use similar mechanisms for transcript termination.A recent in-cell biochemical analysis of SARS-CoV2 RNA structure showed nucleotide reactivity consistent with this model within these stem-loops.These analyses provide a rationale for preferential emergence of ΔH69/V70 and other deletions, such as the well-described NTD antibody escape deletion ΔY144 (in B.1.1.7 and the recently reported B.1.525) at the terminal loops of helical loop motifs.ΔH69/V70 itself has frequently followed immune escape-associated amino acid replacements in the RBD (e.g., N439K and Y453F) and is specifically found in the B.1.1.7 variant, known to have higher transmissibility and, possibly, pathogenicity.We find that ΔH69/V70 does not significantly reduce the sensitivity of spike to neutralizing antibodies in serum from a group of recovered individuals or binding of multiple mAbs directed against the NTD.In addition, we have shown that repair of ΔH69/V70 does not appreciably alter the potency of NTD antibodies against the B.1.1.7 spike.Thus, the deletion is unlikely to be an immune escape mechanism.",1,16
17,17,"In addition, we have shown that repair of ΔH69/V70 does not appreciably alter the potency of NTD antibodies against the B.1.1.7 spike.Thus, the deletion is unlikely to be an immune escape mechanism.Instead, our experimental results demonstrate that ΔH69/V70 is able increase infectivity of the Wuhan-1 D614G spike PV as well as the PV bearing the additional RBD mutations N439K or Y453F, explaining why the deletion is often observed after these immune escape mutations that carry infectivity cost.We show that the mechanism of enhanced infectivity across the RBD mutations tested is associated with greater spike incorporation into virions where ΔH69/V70 is present.The phenotype is also independent of producer cells used.Importantly, we were able to recapitulate the ΔH69/V70 phenotype in a spike protein that did not have the D614G mutation, indicating that D614G is not involved in the mechanism.These observations are supported by ΔH69/V70 being observed in D614 viruses in January 2020 in the United States and Thailand.Although we did not use a replication-competent system, a recent study reports that the ΔH69/V70 mutated Washington strain virus isolate confers increased replication in cell lines and higher viral loads in hamsters.Indeed, ΔH69 has been observed in cell culture during remdesivir selection experiments with a replication-competent virus, consistent with a replication advantage.We have found consistent differences in spike as well as cleaved spike in the producer cell and its incorporation into PV particles when comparing ΔH69/V70 with a Wuhan-1 spike (both with D614G).This could be explained by stability during intracellular trafficking or the route taken to the surface, differences in post-translational modification of the spike protein, or membrane characteristics at the budding site of virus or virus-like particles.Because the amount of spike incorporation into virions reflects the spike in the cells, virion formation is likely unaffected by ΔH69/V70.Interestingly, although pharmacological inhibition of furin by CMK in producer cells did prevent S1/S2 cleavage and altered the balance of S2:FL spike in cells and virions, PV infectivity was not reduced by drug treatment.These data suggest that the increase in entry efficiency conferred by spike ΔH69/V70 is independent of spike S1/S2 cleavage.Similar findings regarding the lack of relationship between the balance of S2:FL and infectivity have been reported in the context of furin knockout cells rather than furin inhibition with CMK.In addition, a recent report on the S1/S2 cleavage site mutation P681H demonstrated that enhanced cleavage of spike P681H was not associated with increased PV infectivity or cell fusion relative to the WT.",1,17
18,18,"Similar findings regarding the lack of relationship between the balance of S2:FL and infectivity have been reported in the context of furin knockout cells rather than furin inhibition with CMK.In addition, a recent report on the S1/S2 cleavage site mutation P681H demonstrated that enhanced cleavage of spike P681H was not associated with increased PV infectivity or cell fusion relative to the WT.There may, however, be differences in vivo.We explored the entry route of ΔH69/V70 spike using cathepsin inhibition to block endosomal entry and camostat to block entry via plasma membrane fusion.ΔH69/V70 spike was as sensitive to camostat and the cathepsin inhibitor ED64 as the WT, arguing that the efficiency of entry route is similar despite differences in cleaved spike.Although S1/S2 cleavage allows avoidance of endosome-associated IFITM restriction and appears to be critical for transmission in animal models, cleaved spike may be less infectious when S1 is shed prematurely, possibly conferring a disadvantage under some circumstances.In addition, showed that S1/S2 cleavage in the producer cell, conferred by a polybasic stretch at the cleavage site, is advantageous in cells expressing abundant TMPRSS2 but deleterious in cells lacking TMPRSS2.The Alpha variant Al (B.1.1.7), bearing seven spike mutations, is responsible for a new pandemic phase that is demonstrably more pathogenic and more transmissible.Detection of a high number of novel mutations suggests that this lineage has been introduced from a geographic region with very poor sampling or that viral evolution may have occurred in a single individual in the context of chronic infection.We show that Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike has similar infectivity as WT D614G spike, consistent with data on live B.1.1.7 virus in human airway epithelial cells but in contrast to another study that showed a difference in live virus with the 8 spike mutations.Importantly, however, we demonstrate loss of infectivity when the H69/V70 amino acids are replaced in B.1.1.7 S, accompanied, as expected, by reduced S1/S2 cleavage and reduced S incorporation into virions.These data point to epistatic interactions between observed mutations in spike of B.1.1.7 with a trade-off between mutations that incur virus entry cost with those that contribute to other activities, such as immune evasion.Of greatest potential importance is our observation that Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster syncytium formation and that this enhanced cell-cell fusion activity is dependent on ΔH69/V70.Syncytium formation is a key feature of severe and fatal COVID-19 and implicated in elevated viral replication.",1,18
