0,"Recurrent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 spike deletion H69/V70 and its role in the Alpha variant B.1.1.7SummaryWe report severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike ΔH69/V70 in multiple independent lineages, often occurring after acquisition of receptor binding motif replacements such as N439K and Y453F, known to increase binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor and confer antibody escape.In vitro, we show that, although ΔH69/V70 itself is not an antibody evasion mechanism, it increases infectivity associated with enhanced incorporation of cleaved spike into virions.ΔH69/V70 is able to partially rescue infectivity of spike proteins that have acquired N439K and Y453F escape mutations by increased spike incorporation.In addition, replacement of the H69 and V70 residues in the Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike (where ΔH69/V70 occurs naturally) impairs spike incorporation and entry efficiency of the B.1.1.7 spike pseudotyped virus.Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster kinetics of cell-cell fusion than wild-type Wuhan-1 D614G, dependent on ΔH69/V70.Therefore, as ΔH69/V70 compensates for immune escape mutations that impair infectivity, continued surveillance for deletions with functional effects is warranted.Graphical abstractHighlightsSpike ΔH69/V70 does not confer escape from antibodiesSpike ΔH69/V70 increases cleaved S2 and spike infectivityB.1.1.7 requires ΔH69/V70 for efficient cleaved spike incorporation and infectivityB.1.1.7 spike requires ΔH69/V70 for rapid syncytium formationMeng et al.report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike ΔH69/V70 has arisen multiple times.The deletion increases entry efficiency associated with increased cleaved spike in virions and can compensate for loss of infectivity.The B.1.1.7 spike requires ΔH69/V70 for efficient cell entry and cell-cell fusion activity.IntroductionSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike surface glycoprotein engagement of human angiotensin-converting enzyme (hACE2) is essential for virus entry and infection, and the receptor is found in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts."
1,"The deletion increases entry efficiency associated with increased cleaved spike in virions and can compensate for loss of infectivity.The B.1.1.7 spike requires ΔH69/V70 for efficient cell entry and cell-cell fusion activity.IntroductionSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike surface glycoprotein engagement of human angiotensin-converting enzyme (hACE2) is essential for virus entry and infection, and the receptor is found in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.Despite this critical interaction and the imposed constraints, it appears that the receptor binding domain (RBD) is relatively tolerant to mutations, raising the real possibility of virus escape from past infection or vaccine-induced immunity and monoclonal antibody treatments.Spike mutants exhibiting reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies have been identified in in vitro screens, and some of these mutations have been found in clinical isolates.Studying chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection can give insights into virus evolution that would require many chains of acute transmission to generate.This is because the majority of infections arise as a result of early transmission during pre- or asymptomatic phases prior to peak adaptive responses, and virus adaptation is not observed because the virus is usually cleared by the immune response.We recently documented de novo emergence of antibody evasion mutations mediated by spike gene mutations in an individual treated with convalescent plasma (CP).In addition, a chronically infected immune-suppressed individual has been reported recently in Russia with emergence of Y453F along with ΔH69/V70.Deletions in other parts of the N-terminal domain (NTD) have been reported to arise in chronic infection and reduce sensitivity to NTD-specific neutralizing antibodies.Here we analyze global SARS-CoV-2 data and find that ΔH69/V70 occurs independently, often emerging after a significant RBD amino acid replacement, such as Y453F and N439K, which are known to facilitate neutralizing antibody escape or alter ACE2 binding while incurring an infectivity defect, according to some reports.Although structural modeling indicates that H69/V70 is in an exposed loop that contracts after deletion, potentially altering an antigenic site, we report that the ΔH69/V70 does not confer significantly reduced susceptibility to convalescent sera or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).Functionally, we find that ΔH69/V70 does increase spike infectivity and compensates for an infectivity defect resulting from the RBD replacements N439K and Y453F.The infectivity increase is driven by higher levels of spike incorporation into virions.We demonstrate that the deletion is required for optimal infectivity of the 501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7) spike protein.We show that, although B.1.1.7 and the wild-type (WT) spike pseudotyped virus (PV) have similar infectivity on a range of target cell types, the B.1.1.7 spike protein alone induces more rapid cell-cell fusion and formation of multinucleated cells."
2,"We demonstrate that the deletion is required for optimal infectivity of the 501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7) spike protein.We show that, although B.1.1.7 and the wild-type (WT) spike pseudotyped virus (PV) have similar infectivity on a range of target cell types, the B.1.1.7 spike protein alone induces more rapid cell-cell fusion and formation of multinucleated cells.Repair of the two amino acids not only leads to reduced B.1.1.7 spike incorporation into virions and impaired infectivity but also reduces cell-cell fusion kinetics back to WT levels.ResultsMultiple occurrences and transmission of spike ΔH69/V70 with and without spike mutationsGlobal snapshot of SARS-CoV-2 lineages associated with ΔH69/V70 and RBM mutations(A) Maximum-likelihood phylogeny of global SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences, highlighting those with specific mutations in spike: ΔH69/V70, N439K, Y453F, and N501Y.The tree is subsampled, and tips are colored by geographic region (see key).Grey bars on the right show the presence or absence of the ΔH69/V70 and amino acid variants N439K, Y453F, and N501Y.Pangolin lineages are shown.(B and C) Cumulative occurrences of SARS-CoV-2 sequences with ΔH69/V70 by month for (B) ΔH69/V70 with or without N439K/Y453F and (C) ΔH69/V70 with N501Y.Indicated frequencies are by month, and all data were collected from the GISAID database (http://gisaid.org, accessed May 21, 2021) and sorted by reporting country and sampling date.The deletion H69/V70 is present in over 600,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences worldwide and has seen global expansion, particularly across much of Europe, Africa, and Asia (Figure 1).ΔH69/V70 is observed in multiple global lineages (Figure 1A).Although variants with deletions in this region of spike are observed in GISAID, the earliest unambiguous sequences that included the ΔH69/V70 were detected on a D614 background in January 2020 (United States and Thailand).The earliest ΔH69/V70 detected on a D614G background occurred in Sweden in April 2020.Prevalence of ΔH69/V70 has increased since August 2020 (Figure 1B)."
3,"The earliest ΔH69/V70 detected on a D614G background occurred in Sweden in April 2020.Prevalence of ΔH69/V70 has increased since August 2020 (Figure 1B).Further analysis of sequences revealed, first, that single deletion of H69 or V70 was uncommon and, second, that some lineages of ΔH69/V70 alone were present as well as ΔH69/V70 in the context of other mutations in spike, specifically those in the receptor binding motif (RBM; Figure 1).ΔH69/V70 is not a neutralizing antibody escape mechanismSpike ΔH69/V70 does not reduce sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies(A) Surface representation of the spike homotrimer in the open conformation (PDB: 7C2L), with each monomer shown in different shades of gray.On the monomer shown positioned to the right, the exposed loop consisting of residues 69–77 is shown in cyan and the neutralizing antibody (4A8)-binding NTD epitope in magenta.(B) Prediction of conformational change in the spike NTD because of deletion of residues His69 and Val70.The pre-deletion structure is shown in cyan, except for residues 69 and 70, which are shown in red.The predicted post-deletion structure is shown in green.Residues 66–77 of the pre-deletion structure are shown in stick representation and colored by atom (nitrogen in blue, oxygen in coral).Yellow lines connect aligned residues 66–77 of the pre- and post-deletion structures, and the distance of 6 Å between aligned alpha carbons of Thr73 in the pre- and post-deletion conformation is labeled.(C) Neutralization of spike ΔH69/V70 PV and WT (D614G background) by convalescent sera from 15 donors.GMT (geometric mean titer) with SD presented is representative of two independent experiments, each with two technical repeats.Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test; ns, not significant.(D) Ten example neutralization curves.Indicated is serum log10 inverse dilution against percent neutralization.Data points represent means of technical replicates, and error bars represent SD.Curves are representative of two independent experiments.(E–G) Kinetics of binding to WT and ΔH69/V70 NTD of 12 NTD-specific mAbs.(E) Biolayer interferometry analysis of binding to wild-type (WT; black) and WT ΔH69/V70 (red) NTDs by 12 NTD-targeting mAbs.Dotted lines separate the association phase from the dissociation phase.Shown is 1 of 2 independent experiments."

To explore whether D614G was required for this enhanced spike cleavage and infectivity, we generated PVs bearing D614 spike with and without ΔH69/V70, followed by infection of HEK293T cells."

To explore whether D614G was required for this enhanced spike cleavage and infectivity, we generated PVs bearing D614 spike with and without ΔH69/V70, followed by infection of HEK293T cells.We observed a similar 2-fold enhancement of infection and a proportional increase in spike incorporation as we did for D614G spike PVs (Figures S1A and S1B).Finally, to exclude the possibility that increased incorporation of S was specific for pseudotyped lentiviral particles, we generated coronavirus-like particles by co-transfection of WT or ΔH69/V70 S with SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, as described previously.Compared with levels of N, levels of cleaved S in coronavirus-like particles were again enhanced in the presence of the ΔH69/V70 (Figures S1C and S1D).Enhanced infectivity of ΔH69/V70 spike is not correlated with cleavage or entry routeThe route of SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated virus entry in cell lines is not altered by ΔH69/V70 spike(A) Schematic illustrating spike in producer cells with CMK targeting and blocking furin cleavage (left panel).In target cells, camostat inhibits TMPRSS2 and, therefore, cell fusion at the plasma membrane, and E64D blocks cathepsins and targets endocytic viral entry (right panel).(B) Western blots show that CMK inhibits spike S1/S2 cleavage in producer cells transfected with the S ΔH69/V70 plasmid, and spikes with altered S1/S2 cleavage are incorporated into the virions.Antibodies against HIV-1 p24 and spike S2 were used with anti-GAPDH as a loading control.(C) The viruses produced from transfected HEK293T cells in the presence of CMK were used to transduce target cells.The luciferase reading is used as a surrogate for the spike infectivity bearing with various S2/FL ratios.The data shown are technical triplicates or quadruplicates, and statical analysis was done using an unpaired t test.(D) Comparison of the infectivity of spike with the PBCS deleted (ΔPBCS) with and without ΔH69/V70.The effect of ΔH69/V70 is independent of the PBCS.(E) ΔH69/V70 does not alter the virus entry route.S pseudotyped lentiviruses bearing WT S, ΔH69/V70 S, or VSV-G were used to transduce 293T-ACE2 or 293T-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells in the presence of E64D or camostat at different drug concentrations."
8,"(E) ΔH69/V70 does not alter the virus entry route.S pseudotyped lentiviruses bearing WT S, ΔH69/V70 S, or VSV-G were used to transduce 293T-ACE2 or 293T-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells in the presence of E64D or camostat at different drug concentrations.The cells were then harvested after 2 days and assayed for luciferase expression, which was then normalized against the non-drug control (set as 100%).The data shown are technical duplicates.The data are representative of at least two independent experiments.SARS-CoV-2 entry into target cells is thought to take place by two distinct routes following binding to ACE2 (Figure 4A).The first is an endosomal route where cathepsin is able to cleave spike with pH-dependent fusion in the endosome.The second route involves fusion at the plasma membrane with cleavage via the plasma membrane-associated protease TMPRSS2.To determine the mechanism by which increased spike cleavage in the context of ΔH69/V70 might affect entry, we used an inhibitor of furin cleavage (CMK) and protease inhibitors specific to the endosomal (ED64D) and plasma membrane fusion (camostat) entry routes (Figure 4A).We first treated producer cells with CMK and found that CMK inhibits spike S1/S2 cleavage in producer cells transfected with the S ΔH69/V70 plasmid and that the spikes with altered S1/S2 cleavage are incorporated into the virions (Figure 4B).We found that CMK treatment, although reducing S1/S2 cleavage, did not decrease PV infection in a variety of target cells (Figure 4C), suggesting that the increased infectivity in ΔH69/V70 is not due to more efficient cleavage of spike.To confirm our findings, we generated a spike lacking the polybasic cleavage site (PBCS) with or without ΔH69/V70 and tested PV infectivity on HEK293T cells overexpressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2.We found that deletion of the polybasic cleavage site led to increased infectivity of the PV, as observed previously for mutated PBCS.As expected, deletion of the PBCS did not alter the enhancing effect of ΔH69/V70 on PV infectivity (Figure 4D).The altered level of S1/S2 cleavage in SARS-CoV-2 has been linked to its dependence on viral entry through membrane fusion or endocytosis in HEK293T and A549 cells.We therefore hypothesized that the increased spike cleavage of ΔH69/V70 S could influence the route of entry.To probe this, spike pseudotyped lentiviruses bearing WT spike, ΔH69/V70 spike, or vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) were used to transduce HEK293T-ACE2 or HEK293T-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells in the presence of E64D or camostat at different drug concentrations (Figure 4E)."
9,"We therefore hypothesized that the increased spike cleavage of ΔH69/V70 S could influence the route of entry.To probe this, spike pseudotyped lentiviruses bearing WT spike, ΔH69/V70 spike, or vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) were used to transduce HEK293T-ACE2 or HEK293T-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells in the presence of E64D or camostat at different drug concentrations (Figure 4E).As expected, the VSV-G pseudotyped particles were not affected by addition of E64D or camostat.Consistent with previous observations, the WT PV utilized endocytosis in the absence of TMPRSS2, but where TMPRSS2 was expressed, plasma membrane fusion became the dominant route.However, there were no differences between WT and ΔH69/V70 in relative utilization of the endosomal versus plasma membrane entry routes.We conclude that the enhanced spike cleavage, although notable in ΔH69/V70, does not appear to be responsible for the increased infectivity of ΔH69/V70 spike observed in these cell line-based experiments.ΔH69/V70 spike compensates for reduced infectivity of RBD escape mutantsΔH69/V70 appears after spike N439K and Y453F and compensates for their reduced infectivity(A and B) Maximum-likelihood phylogeny of global sequences carrying Spike mutant (A) N439K and (B) Y453F.All sequences in the GISAID database containing S:439K or S:Y453F (February 18, 2021) were downloaded, realigned to Wuhan-Hu-1 using MAFFT, and deduplicated.(C) Representation of the Spike RBM:ACE2 interface (PDB: 6M0J) with residues N439, Y453, and N501, highlighted as spheres colored by element.(D–F) Spike mutant ΔH69/V70 compensates for the infectivity defect of spike RBD mutations and is associated with increased spike incorporation into virions.(D) Infectivity of spike (D614G) ΔH69/V70 in the absence and presence of spike RBD mutations.Shown is single-round infection by luciferase-expressing lentiviruses pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on target HeLa cells stably transduced with ACE2.Mean and SEM are shown.(E) Representative western blot of purified virions and cell lysates probed with antibodies against HIV-1 p24, SARS-CoV-2 spike S2, and GAPDH.(F and G) Densitometric quantification of the (F) spike:p24 and (G) cleaved S2 spike:FL spike ratios for spike (D614G) ΔH69/V70 in the absence and presence of spike RBD mutations across multiple experiments in pelleted viruses.U, unit of reverse transcriptase (RT) activity.Data are representative of at least two independent experiments."

B.1.1.7 appeared to mediate more cell-cell fusion events over earlier time points, with the color overlap area being 2–3 times greater for B.1.1.7 compared with the WT 6 h after mixing.Interestingly, this enhancement was abrogated by re-insertion of the H69 and V70 residues (Figures 7B–7D).We conclude that B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster fusion kinetics than the WT bearing D614G Wuhan-1 spike that is dependent on ΔH69/V70.ΔH69/V70 does not enhance infectivity of bat coronavirus RaTG13 spikeFinally, to investigate the importance of this part of spike beyond SARS-CoV-2 for other coronaviruses with zoonotic potential, we examined the 69/70 region of spike in a set of other known sarbecoviruses (Figures S4A–S4C)."
15,"Interestingly, this enhancement was abrogated by re-insertion of the H69 and V70 residues (Figures 7B–7D).We conclude that B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster fusion kinetics than the WT bearing D614G Wuhan-1 spike that is dependent on ΔH69/V70.ΔH69/V70 does not enhance infectivity of bat coronavirus RaTG13 spikeFinally, to investigate the importance of this part of spike beyond SARS-CoV-2 for other coronaviruses with zoonotic potential, we examined the 69/70 region of spike in a set of other known sarbecoviruses (Figures S4A–S4C).We observed substantial variability in the region, resulting in frequent insertions or deletions (indels), with some viruses including SARS-CoV having 6- to 7-amino-acid deletions (Figure S4B).This is indicative of high structural plasticity in this protein region that could allow sarbecoviruses to alter their spike conformation.RaTG13 is the evolutionarily closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 for this region and, after RaTG13, is the cluster of 5 CoVs sampled in trafficked pangolins in the Guangxi province.Inspection of the 69/70 region in these virus sequences raises the interesting observation that one of the five viruses in the cluster, P2V, has amino acids 69H and 70L present, whereas the other four have a double amino acid deletion (Figures S4A–S4C).Given that SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the homologous HV insertion at these positions, one explanation is that the proximal common ancestor between SARS-CoV-2 and the Guangxi pangolin cluster had the insertion, which was then lost while circulating in the pangolin population, similar to observations with SARS-CoV-2 in humans.However, the fact that P2V was cultured in Vero E6 cells prior to sequencing (contrary to the other 4, sequenced directly from the pangolin sample) raises the possibility of this being an independent insertion, favored as a monkey cell line-specific adaptation.Interestingly, the double amino acid indel in the pangolin viruses is in frame, in contrast to SARS-CoV-2.Furthermore, the two almost identical bat viruses sequenced recently from Cambodian samples, RShSTT182 and RShSTT200, possess an H69V70 insertion despite being more distantly related to SARS-CoV-2 for this region of spike (Figures S4A–S4C).This independent occurrence of the insertion is suggestive of context-dependent selective pressure playing a role in recurring gain and loss of these two residues in sarbecoviruses.To test whether the fitness effect associated with acquisition of ΔH69/V70 is specific to SARS-CoV-2 and not other sarbecovirus spike backgrounds, we cloned FL S from RaTG13 and generated pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing RaTG13 spike protein as well as a RaTG13 S ΔH69/V70 counterpart."
16,"This independent occurrence of the insertion is suggestive of context-dependent selective pressure playing a role in recurring gain and loss of these two residues in sarbecoviruses.To test whether the fitness effect associated with acquisition of ΔH69/V70 is specific to SARS-CoV-2 and not other sarbecovirus spike backgrounds, we cloned FL S from RaTG13 and generated pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing RaTG13 spike protein as well as a RaTG13 S ΔH69/V70 counterpart.We observed that cleaved and uncleaved S expression levels in the PV did not differ between WT and the ΔH69/V70 RaTG13 spike and that there was no difference in infectivity on target cells expressing ACE2 or ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Figures S4D and S4E).This result suggests that, as one would expect, the enhancing effect of ΔH69/V70 on spike levels and infectivity is specific to the spike background.DiscussionWe have presented data demonstrating multiple independent and circulating lineages of SARS-CoV-2 variants bearing spike ΔH69/V70.This recurring deletion, spanning 6 nt, is due to an out-of-frame deletion of 6 nt and occurs in the terminal loop of a helix loop motif within the predicted RNA structure, as do other NTD deletions observed in new variants, such as B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617 (Delta), B.1.351 (Beta), and P.1 (Gamma) (Figure S5).Stable helix loop motifs are associated with pausing/dissociation events in reverse transcriptase.Because all nucleic acid polymerases have a common ancestor with homologous dinucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) binding motifs and similar global structures, it is probable that all RNA polymerases use similar mechanisms for transcript termination.A recent in-cell biochemical analysis of SARS-CoV2 RNA structure showed nucleotide reactivity consistent with this model within these stem-loops.These analyses provide a rationale for preferential emergence of ΔH69/V70 and other deletions, such as the well-described NTD antibody escape deletion ΔY144 (in B.1.1.7 and the recently reported B.1.525) at the terminal loops of helical loop motifs.ΔH69/V70 itself has frequently followed immune escape-associated amino acid replacements in the RBD (e.g., N439K and Y453F) and is specifically found in the B.1.1.7 variant, known to have higher transmissibility and, possibly, pathogenicity.We find that ΔH69/V70 does not significantly reduce the sensitivity of spike to neutralizing antibodies in serum from a group of recovered individuals or binding of multiple mAbs directed against the NTD.In addition, we have shown that repair of ΔH69/V70 does not appreciably alter the potency of NTD antibodies against the B.1.1.7 spike.Thus, the deletion is unlikely to be an immune escape mechanism."
17,"In addition, we have shown that repair of ΔH69/V70 does not appreciably alter the potency of NTD antibodies against the B.1.1.7 spike.Thus, the deletion is unlikely to be an immune escape mechanism.Instead, our experimental results demonstrate that ΔH69/V70 is able increase infectivity of the Wuhan-1 D614G spike PV as well as the PV bearing the additional RBD mutations N439K or Y453F, explaining why the deletion is often observed after these immune escape mutations that carry infectivity cost.We show that the mechanism of enhanced infectivity across the RBD mutations tested is associated with greater spike incorporation into virions where ΔH69/V70 is present.The phenotype is also independent of producer cells used.Importantly, we were able to recapitulate the ΔH69/V70 phenotype in a spike protein that did not have the D614G mutation, indicating that D614G is not involved in the mechanism.These observations are supported by ΔH69/V70 being observed in D614 viruses in January 2020 in the United States and Thailand.Although we did not use a replication-competent system, a recent study reports that the ΔH69/V70 mutated Washington strain virus isolate confers increased replication in cell lines and higher viral loads in hamsters.Indeed, ΔH69 has been observed in cell culture during remdesivir selection experiments with a replication-competent virus, consistent with a replication advantage.We have found consistent differences in spike as well as cleaved spike in the producer cell and its incorporation into PV particles when comparing ΔH69/V70 with a Wuhan-1 spike (both with D614G).This could be explained by stability during intracellular trafficking or the route taken to the surface, differences in post-translational modification of the spike protein, or membrane characteristics at the budding site of virus or virus-like particles.Because the amount of spike incorporation into virions reflects the spike in the cells, virion formation is likely unaffected by ΔH69/V70.Interestingly, although pharmacological inhibition of furin by CMK in producer cells did prevent S1/S2 cleavage and altered the balance of S2:FL spike in cells and virions, PV infectivity was not reduced by drug treatment.These data suggest that the increase in entry efficiency conferred by spike ΔH69/V70 is independent of spike S1/S2 cleavage.Similar findings regarding the lack of relationship between the balance of S2:FL and infectivity have been reported in the context of furin knockout cells rather than furin inhibition with CMK.In addition, a recent report on the S1/S2 cleavage site mutation P681H demonstrated that enhanced cleavage of spike P681H was not associated with increased PV infectivity or cell fusion relative to the WT."
18,"Similar findings regarding the lack of relationship between the balance of S2:FL and infectivity have been reported in the context of furin knockout cells rather than furin inhibition with CMK.In addition, a recent report on the S1/S2 cleavage site mutation P681H demonstrated that enhanced cleavage of spike P681H was not associated with increased PV infectivity or cell fusion relative to the WT.There may, however, be differences in vivo.We explored the entry route of ΔH69/V70 spike using cathepsin inhibition to block endosomal entry and camostat to block entry via plasma membrane fusion.ΔH69/V70 spike was as sensitive to camostat and the cathepsin inhibitor ED64 as the WT, arguing that the efficiency of entry route is similar despite differences in cleaved spike.Although S1/S2 cleavage allows avoidance of endosome-associated IFITM restriction and appears to be critical for transmission in animal models, cleaved spike may be less infectious when S1 is shed prematurely, possibly conferring a disadvantage under some circumstances.In addition, showed that S1/S2 cleavage in the producer cell, conferred by a polybasic stretch at the cleavage site, is advantageous in cells expressing abundant TMPRSS2 but deleterious in cells lacking TMPRSS2.The Alpha variant Al (B.1.1.7), bearing seven spike mutations, is responsible for a new pandemic phase that is demonstrably more pathogenic and more transmissible.Detection of a high number of novel mutations suggests that this lineage has been introduced from a geographic region with very poor sampling or that viral evolution may have occurred in a single individual in the context of chronic infection.We show that Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike has similar infectivity as WT D614G spike, consistent with data on live B.1.1.7 virus in human airway epithelial cells but in contrast to another study that showed a difference in live virus with the 8 spike mutations.Importantly, however, we demonstrate loss of infectivity when the H69/V70 amino acids are replaced in B.1.1.7 S, accompanied, as expected, by reduced S1/S2 cleavage and reduced S incorporation into virions.These data point to epistatic interactions between observed mutations in spike of B.1.1.7 with a trade-off between mutations that incur virus entry cost with those that contribute to other activities, such as immune evasion.Of greatest potential importance is our observation that Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster syncytium formation and that this enhanced cell-cell fusion activity is dependent on ΔH69/V70.Syncytium formation is a key feature of severe and fatal COVID-19 and implicated in elevated viral replication."

35,"SARS-CoV-2 infection in the mouse olfactory systemSARS-CoV-2 infection causes a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in humans, and olfactory dysfunction is one of the most predictive and common symptoms in COVID-19 patients.However, the underlying mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to olfactory disorders remains elusive.Herein, we demonstrate that intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 induces robust viral replication in the olfactory epithelium (OE), not the olfactory bulb (OB), resulting in transient olfactory dysfunction in humanized ACE2 (hACE2) mice.The sustentacular cells and Bowman's gland cells in the OE were identified as the major target cells of SARS-CoV-2 before invasion into olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs).Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers massive cell death and immune cell infiltration and directly impairs the uniformity of the OE structure.Combined transcriptomic and quantitative proteomic analyses revealed the induction of antiviral and inflammatory responses, as well as the downregulation of olfactory receptor (OR) genes in the OE from the infected animals.Overall, our mouse model recapitulates olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients and provides critical clues for understanding the physiological basis for extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19.IntroductionThe emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to a global crisis.The clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection predominantly involve the respiratory system, including cough, sore throat, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).As the disease continues to spread widely, a significant portion of COVID-19 patients are developing anosmia, hyposmia, or other olfactory dysfunctions according to clinical reports.Accumulated evidence has established the alteration of smell as one of the most predictive symptoms for COVID-19 screening.The perception of smell begins with odorant binding to the olfactory receptors (ORs) of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) along the upper surface of the olfactory epithelium (OE).Each OSN projects an axon into the glomerulus of the olfactory bulb (OB) and then synapses with second-order neurons to convey odour information to the olfactory cortex.Previously, upper respiratory tract infections were considered a common cause of olfactory disorders.Mouse models have been used to reproduce olfactory system infection and subsequent olfactory dysfunction."
36,"Previously, upper respiratory tract infections were considered a common cause of olfactory disorders.Mouse models have been used to reproduce olfactory system infection and subsequent olfactory dysfunction.For example, post viral olfactory disorders were observed in Sendai virus-infected mice by the buried food pellet test (BFPT), as well as the impairment of OE and OB tissues.However, an animal model that can recapitulate the olfactory dysfunctions seen in COVID-19 patients remains lacking.Human nasal respiratory epithelium (RE) cells exhibit high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2.Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses have characterized the expression profile of ACE2 in the OE of mice and humans, mainly in non-neuroepithelial cells, and in a recent study based on a hamster model, many SARS-CoV-2-infected cells were observed in the OE section.In addition, vascular pericytes in the OB exhibited a high level of ACE2 expression in a mouse model; these cells play a key role in the maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, as well as the regulation of blood pressure and the host immune response.Interestingly, some respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus, are able to invade the OB and other parts of the brain to establish infection.Thus, how SARS-CoV-2 invades the olfactory system and contributes to the observed central nervous system (CNS) diseases remains to be determined.In the present study, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection directly causes transient olfactory dysfunction in an established mouse model and characterize the major target cells and pathological effects that contribute to olfactory dysfunction.ResultsSARS-CoV-2 targets the OE and causes transient olfactory dysfunction in hACE2 miceSARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the OE and causes olfactory dysfunction in hACE2 mice.a Schematic diagram of the experimental design.Briefly, groups of 6-8-week-old hACE2 mice were infected with 5.4 x 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 intranasally.The olfactory function of infected mice was measured by the buried food pellet test at the indicated times post inoculation.Mice were sacrificed at 2 dpi and 4 dpi for viral detection and histopathological analysis.b Schematic view of the OM in the nasal cavity of mice in a sagittal plane.The dotted line indicates a coronal section (upper).Viral genomic RNA (gRNA, middle) and subgenomic RNA (sgRNA, lower) copies were determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and are shown as means +- SD from three independent replicates."

38,"Additionally, high levels of viral subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) (2.24 x 108 RNA copies/mouse), indicating the presence of actively replicating virus, were detected in the OM at 2 dpi, and subsequently decreased at 4 dpi (9.89 x 106 RNA copies/mouse); however, the sgRNA levels in the OB and brain were below the detection threshold (Fig.1b).As expected, in situ hybridization (ISH) by RNAscope demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was predominantly detected in OE (Supplementary Fig.S2a) but not in the OB (Supplementary Fig.S2b).Furthermore, an immunofluorescence staining assay detected high levels of SARS-CoV-2 N protein expression in the OE along the OM at 2 dpi (Fig.1c), and only marginal expression of viral protein was observed at 8 dpi (Supplementary Fig.S3).However, we did not detect SARS-CoV-2 N protein-positive cells in the OB or other parts of the brain at 2 dpi and 4 dpi (Supplementary Fig.S2c).To examine whether SARS-CoV-2 infection directly impairs the olfactory function of infected mice, a standard BFPT was conducted at 2 and 4 dpi.Remarkably, a significantly increased latency (152.8 s vs 81.8 s; P = 0.022) to locate food pellets was observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice compared with the control animals at 2 dpi (Fig.1d).Of particular note, 2 out of the 13 infected mice developed severe symptoms of anosmia, as they failed to locate the food pellet within the observation period.Interestingly, recovery of infected mice from olfactory dysfunction was observed at 4 dpi, as the latency to locate food pellets was not different from that of the control animals (67.1 s vs 70.2 s; P = 0.992).Thus, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the OE and leads to transient olfactory dysfunction in mice.SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets non-neuroepithelial cells in the OE of hACE2 miceThe OM consists of the OE and the underlying lamina propria (LP).The OE is composed of olfactory stem/progenitor cells, including the horizontal basal cells (HBCs) and globose basal cells (GBCs) residing in the basal region, mature and immature OSNs, and a variety of non-neuroepithelial lineages, including the sustentacular cells, microvillar cells, and Bowman's gland cells.The OSNs lining under the supporting cells project numerous dendritic cilia with ORs into the nasal cavity and intermingle with the microvilli of sustentacular cells and microvillar cells (Supplementary Fig.S4a).Due to the asymmetrical expression pattern of ACE2 on the cell membrane as well as the unique organization of the OE, it is not easy to determine which cell compartments express ACE2."
39,"S4a).Due to the asymmetrical expression pattern of ACE2 on the cell membrane as well as the unique organization of the OE, it is not easy to determine which cell compartments express ACE2.To overcome this, we took advantage of the tdTomato cassette downstream of the hACE2 transgene with an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which allows the detection of hACE2 expression by cytoplasmic fluorescence of tdTomato (Supplementary Fig.S4b).Abundant expression of hACE2 along the apical surface of the OE and within the underlying LP was detected with a human ACE2-specific monoclonal antibody, exhibiting a similar expression pattern as tdTomato (Supplementary Fig.S4c).A detailed characterization of hACE2/tdTomato-expressing cells in the OM revealed that non-neuroepithelial cells, including sustentacular cells (CK8 positive, Supplementary Fig.S4d, d1), the duct and acinus of Bowman's gland cells (Sox9/CK8 positive, Supplementary Fig.S4d, d2, d4) in the OE and LP, respectively, and microvillar cells (CD73/CK8 positive, Supplementary Fig.S4e), are the primary cell types that exhibit human ACE2 expression (Supplementary Fig.S4d, f), whereas little hACE2/tdTomato expression was detected in the neuroepithelial lineages, including HBCs (CK5 positive), GBCs (Sox2 positive in the basal region), immature olfactory sensory neurons (iOSNs) (GAP43 positive), and mature olfactory sensory neurons (mOSNs) (OMP positive) (Supplementary Fig.S4d, d1-d4).SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets non-neuroepithelial cells in the OE.a Representative multiplex immunofluorescent staining assay showing that SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 N protein positive) infects sustentacular cells (CK8 positive, yellow arrows), Bowman's gland cells (Sox9/CK8 positive, white arrows), microvillar cells (CD73/CK8 positive, cyan arrows), HBCs (CK5 positive, gold arrows), and iOSNs (GAP43 positive, green arrows) at 2 dpi.Little SARS-CoV-2 N protein was detected within OMP-positive mOSNs.b Statistical analysis of the percentage of each cell compartment within SARS-CoV-2-positive cells.The data are presented as means +- SD (n = 3).c Multiplex immunofluorescent staining results showing an OM sample at 4 dpi with SARS-CoV-2 detected in the OMP-positive mOSNs and the underlying nerve bundles.The framed areas labeled c1 and c2 are shown adjacently at larger magnifications."

42,"SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased the number of CK5/Sox2/Ki67 triple-positive cells, strongly suggesting a transition from HBCs to actively cycling GBCs (Supplementary Fig.S5a, a2).Of particular note, prominent upward growth of HBCs from the basal layer into the upper section of the OE was observed in infected animals, which also co-expressed the markers of their lineage offspring, such as iOSNs (Supplementary Fig.S5b, b1), sustentacular cells (Supplementary Fig.S5b, b2), and microvillar cells (Supplementary Fig.S5b, b3).These results suggest that the impaired OE is regenerated through olfactory stem cell-based proliferation and differentiation into olfactory neurons and supporting lineages, thereby restoring the normal function of the OE.SARS-CoV-2 infection induces antiviral and inflammatory responses in the OEHost response to SARS-CoV-2 in the OE at the mRNA and protein levels.a Dot plot visualization of enriched GO terms of upregulated genes/proteins at 2/4 dpi in the OE.Gene enrichment analyses were performed using Metascape against the GO dataset for biological processes.""Reg.""stands for regulation, ""mod.""for modulation, and ""antigen processing.""for antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen.b Interaction map of 30 proteins that were consistently upregulated at both the transcriptomic and proteomic levels over the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the OE.Network nodes represent proteins, and their colors indicate the different GO terms to which they belong.Edges represent protein-protein associations, and their thickness indicates the strength of data support.c Dot plot visualization of enriched KEGG pathways of downregulated genes/proteins at 2/4 dpi in the OE.Gene enrichment analyses were performed using STRING against the KEGG dataset.""Met.""for metabolism.The color of the dots represents the -LogQ value for each enriched KEGG pathway, and size represents the gene/protein counts enriched in each term.d Heatmap indicating the expression patterns of 36 olfactory receptor genes that were significantly downregulated at 2 dpi.The colored bar represents the Z-score of the TPM.A total of 11 genes that were also downregulated at 4 dpi are marked with black triangles.e RNA expression of 13 representative ORs by qRT-PCR.Columns with *, **, *** indicate ORs significantly downregulated at P < 0.05, P < 0.01, or P < 0.001, respectively, relative to their mock groups (one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc analysis with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test, n = 3)."

44,"4b).We did not find any obvious induction of antiviral response-related genes in OB samples by transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, but downregulation of inflammatory response-related genes was observed (Supplementary Fig.S9a, b).Of particular note, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of downregulated transcripts and proteins in the OE showed that genes belonging to ""olfactory transduction"" were significantly enriched (Fig.4c).Among all 100 downregulated transcripts at 2 dpi, 36 encoded ORs (Fig.4d and Supplementary Fig.S6b), while among the 278 downregulated transcripts at 4 dpi, 97 encoded ORs (Supplementary Figs.S6b and S8d).Further qRT-PCR assays showed that 13 representative OR genes were significantly downregulated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig.4e), which may also be attributed to the observed olfactory dysfunction.We further analyzed the expression of other host cell factors that were reported to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cells.The results showed that Nrp1 was significantly downregulated at 2 dpi (Supplementary Fig.S10a), and slight downregulation of Bsg/CD147, Tmprss2, Furin, and Tfrc/transferrin receptor was also detected by RNA-seq analyses (Supplementary Fig.S10b-e).DiscussionIn the present study, we used an established mouse model to demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause olfactory dysfunction and anosmia, and this experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection is the cause of olfactory dysfunction and anosmia in COVID-19 patients.SARS-CoV-2-infected mice exhibited a damaged OE, immune cell infiltration, downregulated OR expression, and impaired olfactory function, largely mimicking the olfactory abnormalities of COVID-19 patients.Robust viral replication and direct antiviral responses were detected in the OE of the infected mice but not in the OB and other parts of the brain, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 mainly infected the OM in the hACE2 mouse model.A recent study also showed that the SARS-CoV-2 protein could be detected in the OE, but not in the OB, in a hamster model.One possible explanation for the absence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS is that virus infection and replication in OE can effectively activate IFN-dependent antiviral responses (Supplementary Fig.S7a, b), which is an effective barrier that prevents viral invasion into the CNS.In addition, the apoptosis of infected OSNs may contribute to the prevention of viral spread into the CNS after the rapid infection and destruction of the OE.Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 invaded brain tissues in K18-hACE2 mice, which expressed hACE2 under the cytokeratin 18 promoter."
45,"In addition, the apoptosis of infected OSNs may contribute to the prevention of viral spread into the CNS after the rapid infection and destruction of the OE.Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 invaded brain tissues in K18-hACE2 mice, which expressed hACE2 under the cytokeratin 18 promoter.These inconsistencies in SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes, including CNS tropism, in different mouse models may be attributed to the different expression profiles of human ACE2 as well as the experimental systems.Our results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 initially infects non-neuroepithelial cells, including sustentacular cells, Bowman's gland cells and microvillar cells, which are involved in OSN support, host immune response, electrolyte balance maintenance, and mucus secretion.Moreover, we observed various levels of damage in the OE after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including cilia desquamation, loss of surface microvilli, and substantial structural disorganization.In addition, our results showed a certain degree of cell apoptosis and inflammatory infiltration at both the cell and molecular levels following SARS-CoV-2 infection.All these data indicate that the damaged supporting non-neuroepithelial cells and inflammatory infiltration caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection contribute to the detrimental effects of the virus on olfactory function.Our results are supported by recent findings in mice and humans, showing that the non-neuroepithelial cells of the OE express high levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 at both the mRNA and protein levels.Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2-positive signals were also observed in HBCs and mOSNs of infected animals at 2 dpi and 4 dpi, respectively (Fig.2a, c), although we did not detect any hACE2 expression in these cells (Supplementary Fig.S4d).The underlying mechanism remains elusive, and an hACE2-independent route of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be considered.According to recent studies, some other host cell receptors were found to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection, including NRP1, CD147, and transferrin receptor.Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 contains a specific furin cleavage site in the spike protein and utilizes TMPRSS2 for further spike protein priming.In our study, we found that the Nrp1, Bsg/CD147, Tmprss2, Furin, and Tfrc/transferrin receptor were downregulated to varying degrees in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice at 2 dpi, as shown by RNA-seq analyses, but whether these proteins play critical roles in olfactory dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 infection in our animal model remains unknown and warrants extensive investigation.We observed that many ORs were significantly downregulated at 2 and 4 dpi, suggesting the occurrence of decreased olfaction after SARS-CoV-2 infection."
46,"Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 contains a specific furin cleavage site in the spike protein and utilizes TMPRSS2 for further spike protein priming.In our study, we found that the Nrp1, Bsg/CD147, Tmprss2, Furin, and Tfrc/transferrin receptor were downregulated to varying degrees in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice at 2 dpi, as shown by RNA-seq analyses, but whether these proteins play critical roles in olfactory dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 infection in our animal model remains unknown and warrants extensive investigation.We observed that many ORs were significantly downregulated at 2 and 4 dpi, suggesting the occurrence of decreased olfaction after SARS-CoV-2 infection.A recent study also showed that induction of antiviral type I interferon signaling in the mouse OE was associated with diminished odour discrimination and decreased RNA levels of ORs.These findings may support what we observed in this study: SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a significant interferon response and dramatic OR decrease simultaneously in the OE.We also observed that the levels of three odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), which are compact globular water-soluble proteins with ligand-binding capabilities and are thought to aid in the capture and transport of odorants to the ORs, significantly decreased at the protein level with OE infection.In addition, although no viral infection was observed in the OB, we detected some up/downregulated transcripts or proteins by transcriptomic and proteomic analyses.Notably, among all four proteins co-regulated at both the transcriptomic and proteomic levels, Rtp1 (receptor-transporting protein 1) was downregulated at both levels (Supplementary Table S1).This protein specifically promotes functional cell surface expression of ORs, suggesting that the inhibition of Rtp1 in OB may lead to downregulation of ORs.Therefore, OE damage, which is closely related to olfactory dysfunction, is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection of non-neuroepithelial cells and OSNs synergizes with the host antiviral immune responses.According to our results, the olfactory dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals was recoverable, as almost all animals recovered their normal sense of smell at 4 dpi.Additionally, studies focusing on COVID-19 patients with anosmia have shown that most of them recover from loss of smell within a few weeks or less, and only a small number of patients reported slow partial recovery over 1 to 3 months, indicating a potential mechanism of OE regeneration from injuries.The hACE2 mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection reproduces the clinical course and viral replication observed in COVID-19 patients, as it mimics the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the transient olfactory dysfunction observed in human individuals.The difference in the time span of viral infection and clearance between humans and mice reflected the inherent differences between the species.The OE undergoes lifelong regeneration and replacement depending on two populations of basal stem cells, namely, HBCs and GBCs.HBCs are mitotically quiescent under normal conditions and become activated and differentiate into other kinds of cells once OE damage occurs.Unlike HBCs, most GBCs are mitotically activated and are responsible for the regeneration of both neuronal and non-neuronal cells."
47,"HBCs are mitotically quiescent under normal conditions and become activated and differentiate into other kinds of cells once OE damage occurs.Unlike HBCs, most GBCs are mitotically activated and are responsible for the regeneration of both neuronal and non-neuronal cells.Indeed, we observed regeneration of the OE, as indicated by the significant proliferation and morphological change of HBCs, accompanied by the differentiation of stem cells into iOSNs, sustentacular cells and microvillar cells.In this way, the structural basis and function of the OE as well as olfactory function can be restored to normal in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals.Furthermore, it was indicated that the damage and apoptosis of OSNs are closely involved in their regeneration, and the occurrence of an inflammatory response also facilitates stem cell differentiation and OE regeneration.At the transcriptomic and proteomic levels, we observed upregulated ""regulation of neuron projection development"" genes/proteins at 2 and 4 dpi, implying the progression of a neuron projection over time from its formation to the mature structure.Interestingly, although there were many significantly downregulated ORs at 4 dpi, the mRNA levels of many ORs increased slightly compared with those at 2 dpi, indicating that OR expression tends to recover to normal levels.In summary, our study established a mouse model of olfactory dysfunction induced by SARS-CoV-2.Considering the interspecies discrepancy in olfactory construction between rodents and humans, e.g., the relative size of the OB to the brain, the proportion of the brain involved in olfaction, and the expression of ORs, further studies are recommended to reproduce SARS-CoV-2-induced olfactory dysfunction in other animal models, especially nonhuman primates.Additionally, validating the targets and biological effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human specimens should still be considered.An animal model of olfactory disorders is available to subsequently evaluate antiviral drugs as well as vaccines for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 and for the improvement of post viral olfactory disorders.Materials and MethodsCell and virusVero cells were maintained at 37  C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 10 mM HEPES, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.The SARS-CoV-2 strain BetaCoV/Beijing/IMEBJ05/2020 (No.GWHACBB01000000) was originally isolated from a COVID-19 patient.For virus propagation, Vero cells were incubated with SARS-CoV-2, and the culture supernatants were collected at 3 dpi.The stock of SARS-CoV-2 was serially diluted and titrated on monolayers of Vero cells."

A total of 60 fractions were collected and then combined into 15 fractions before vacuum drying according to the peak abundance.The combined samples were dissolved in loading buffer (1% ACN and 1% formic acid (FA)) and analyzed using an EASY-nLC 1200 ultra-performance liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with a self-packed capillary column (75 mum i.d.x 15 cm, 3 mum C18 reversed-phase fused silica), with a 78-min nonlinear gradient at a flow rate of 600 nL/min.The gradient was as follows: an increase from 6%-15% solvent B (0.1% FA in 80% ACN) in 15 min, 15%-30% in 40 min, 30%-40% in 15 min, and 40%-100% in 1 min, finally holding at 100% for 7 min.The eluted peptides were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA).MS1 data were collected in the Orbitrap using a 120 k resolution over an m/z range of 300-1500, with the maximum injection time (MIT) set to 50 ms.The automatic gain control (AGC) was set to 4 x 105, determined charge states between 2 and 7 were subjected to fragmentation via higher energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) with 37% collision energy, and a 12 s dynamic exclusion window was used with isotopes excluded.For the MS/MS scans, the fractions were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 50 k. For each scan, the isolation width was 1.6 m/z, the AGC was 5 x 104, and the MIT was 86 ms.Database searchThe raw files from the OE and OB groups were searched with MaxQuant (v1.5.5.0) against the mouse reviewed proteome downloaded from UniProt, containing 17,478 entries and a canonical SARS-CoV-2 proteome with 30 potential viral proteins from the SARS-CoV-2 genome (NC_045512.2), and a common contaminant database (http://www.maxquant.org/contaminants.zip), respectively.Fully tryptic peptides with as many as 2 missed were allowed.TMT 10 plex (N-Term/K) and cysteine carbamidomethyl were set as fixed modifications, whereas oxidation of methionine was set as a variable modification.The tolerance of the precursor and fragment ions was set to 20 ppm.Bioinformatic analysesDESeq2 v1.6.3 was used for differential gene expression analysis."

60,"Human‐to‐animal transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 is well‐documented in pets (Hosie et al., ), which typically become infected after exposure to owners with COVID‐19 (OIE).However, the impact of infections with SARS‐CoV‐2 variants of concern on the clinical presentation and duration of infection in pets and the transmissibility between people and pets remains unknown.Since June 2020, we have conducted a longitudinal household transmission study of pets living with one or more persons with COVID‐19 (Hamer et al.,) to better understand the role of virus transmission between humans and pets.As part of this ongoing study, two pets from the same household were sampled for SARS‐CoV‐2 on 12 February 2021, two days after their owner—one of two residents in a home in Brazos County, Texas—received a positive test result for COVID‐19 through a commercial laboratory; no viral sequence was generated from the owner.The pets—the only animals in the home—were a 15‐year‐old Labrador retriever mix dog and a 12‐year‐old domestic shorthair cat.On initial visit, the animals were asymptomatic.The owner described a high degree of contact with both pets, including sleeping in the same room (dog) and bed (cat).Following previously described methods (Hamer et al.,), oral, nasal and fur swabs from both pets were found to be positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 by real‐time (RT) PCR.Rectal swabs tested negative.Sera tested negative for SARS‐CoV‐2 neutralizing antibodies using a 96‐well virus neutralization test as previously described (Table 1; McAloose et al.,).Live virus isolation was attempted from all positive samples and was successful from the cat's nasal swab.SARS‐CoV‐2 whole‐genome sequencing was attempted and successful from the cat's nasal swab and the dog's oral swab.Consensus sequences from both animals were 100% identical to each other and were identified as the B.1.1.7 variant of concern by single‐nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis and alignment.In addition to characteristic B.1.1.7 mutations, sequences from both animals also showed 8 SNPs in ORF1ab and ORF8.Longitudinal SARS‐CoV‐2 test results for a pet dog and cat from the same household in Texas that were confirmed for infection with the B.1.1.7."

Neutralizing antibodies were detected in both animals (Table 1).This study documents the first detection of B.1.1.7.in companion animals in the United States, and the first genome recovery and isolation of B.1.1.7 variant of concern globally in any animal.These findings are coincident with detection of B.1.1.7 infection in rectal swabs of three U.K. pets with myocarditis (Ferasin et al.,).These results support public health guidance that recommends people with COVID‐19 isolate from animals (CDC, ) and the continued application of a One Health approach to SARS‐CoV‐2 investigations.Given the continued emergence (Galloway et al.,) and enhanced transmissibility and pathogenicity of B.1.1.7 in humans (Davies, Abbott, et al., ), onward transmission of this and other variants of concern from animals should remain the subject of ongoing research.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTThe authors declare no conflict of interest.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSS.A.H, R.

65,"Impact and effectiveness of mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations, and deaths following a nationwide vaccination campaign in Israel: an observational study using national surveillance dataBackgroundFollowing the emergency use authorisation of the Pfizer–BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 (international non-proprietary name tozinameran) in Israel, the Ministry of Health (MoH) launched a campaign to immunise the 6·5 million residents of Israel aged 16 years and older.We estimated the real-world effectiveness of two doses of BNT162b2 against a range of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes and to evaluate the nationwide public-health impact following the widespread introduction of the vaccine.MethodsWe used national surveillance data from the first 4 months of the nationwide vaccination campaign to ascertain incident cases of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and outcomes, as well as vaccine uptake in residents of Israel aged 16 years and older.Vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 outcomes (asymptomatic infection, symptomatic infection, and COVID-19-related hospitalisation, severe or critical hospitalisation, and death) was calculated on the basis of incidence rates in fully vaccinated individuals (defined as those for whom 7 days had passed since receiving the second dose of vaccine) compared with rates in unvaccinated individuals (who had not received any doses of the vaccine), with use of a negative binomial regression model adjusted for age group (16–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65–74, 75–84, and ≥85 years), sex, and calendar week.The proportion of spike gene target failures on PCR test among a nationwide convenience-sample of SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens was used to estimate the prevelance of the B.1.1.7 variant.FindingsDuring the analysis period (Jan 24 to April 3, 2021), there were 232 268 SARS-CoV-2 infections, 7694 COVID-19 hospitalisations, 4481 severe or critical COVID-19 hospitalisations, and 1113 COVID-19 deaths in people aged 16 years or older.By April 3, 2021, 4 714 932 (72·1%) of 6 538 911 people aged 16 years and older were fully vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2."

67,"These findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination can help to control the pandemic.FundingNone.IntroductionAs of April 3, 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in more than 131 million cases and more than 2·8 million deaths worldwide, including 821 748 cases and 6236 deaths in Israel (population 9·1 million).Among the SARS-CoV-2 strains characterised globally in 2020, the D614G variant was dominant.More recently, the SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK and associated with increased transmissibility, has emerged in several countries.B.1.1.7 was first reported in Israel on Dec 23, 2020.Research in context Evidence before this study The Pfizer–BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2, administered as two doses 21 days apart, was authorised for emergency use in Israel in December, 2020, after it was shown to have high efficacy against symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in a randomised controlled trial of individuals aged 16 years and older.Since the initiation of vaccine rollout, we have been closely monitoring the scientific literature (including preprint servers) and press coverage to identify reports of BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness.Although observational studies have estimated the effectiveness of BNT162b2, precise nationwide effectiveness estimates of two doses of BNT162b2 against SARS-CoV-2 outcomes are lacking.More data are particularly needed regarding the vaccine's effectiveness against severe disease and deaths, and effectiveness in older adults.Finally, no country has yet described the nationwide public health impact of a national COVID-19 vaccination campaign.Added value of this study This analysis of nationwide surveillance data, done in a period when SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 was the dominant strain, provides precise real-world estimates of the high effectiveness of two doses of BNT162b2 against a range of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infection and hospitalisation or death due to COVID-19.The median follow-up time of 7 weeks after the second dose for vaccinated individuals was longer than that in previous reports.Marked and sustained declines in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections were observed in all age groups as the percentage of individuals vaccinated with two BNT162b2 doses began to rise, thereby showing, at a national level, the beneficial public health impact of a nationwide vaccination campaign.Implications of all the available evidence Vaccination with two doses of BNT162b2 has high efficacy and effectiveness against a range of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes, including among older adults (aged ≥85 years), offering hope that COVID-19 vaccination will eventually control the pandemic."

70,"When seeking testing, individuals provide their identification number and a specimen is collected via nasal or nasopharyngeal swab.Specimens are tested, using national testing standards, at one of 48 clinical diagnostic laboratories with use of real-time PCR tests.B.1.1.7 prevalence was estimated on the basis of swabs tested at Leumit with the TaqPath COVID-19 test (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pleasanton, CA, USA), which identifies spike gene target failure (SGTF) associated with gene mutations that cause deletions of amino acids 69 and 70 in the spike protein.Because these mutations are found in B.1.1.7, SGTF is used to estimate the prevalence of this variant.Public health surveillanceMoH conducts surveillance for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, with mandatory daily reporting of PCR results by all diagnostic laboratories.An epidemiological investigation, including an interview about COVID-19 symptoms, is done for each SARS-CoV-2 infection, usually within 2 days of diagnosis.MoH also conducts surveillance of COVID-19-associated hospitalisations.Daily updates are received from all hospitals and linked to the national database using patients' identification numbers.Hospitalisations are classified as severe (if a patient has a resting respiratory rate of >30 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation on room air of <94%, or a ratio of PaO2 to FiO2 of <300) or critical (in the event of mechanical ventilation, shock, or cardiac, hepatic, or renal failure).In accordance with national guidelines, health-care providers attributed any hospitalisations and deaths among individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection to COVID-19.OutcomesVaccine effectiveness estimates were assessed against six SARS-CoV-2 outcomes, comprising asymptomatic infections and five other hierarchical laboratory-confirmed outcomes: all SARS-CoV-2 infections (symptomatic and asymptomatic), symptomatic COVID-19 cases, and COVID-19-related hospitalisations, severe or critical hospitalisations (including those who died), and deaths.Asymptomatic infection was defined as a person with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who reported no fever and no respiratory symptoms during the symptom interview portion of the epidemiological investigation, and who was not subsequently hospitalised for or did not die from COVID-19.Statistical analysisIndividuals were defined as unvaccinated if they had not received any doses of BNT162b2, and as fully vaccinated if at least 7 days had passed since receiving the second dose of BNT162b2.Incidence rates were calculated for unvaccinated and fully vaccinated individuals aged 16 years and older for each SARS-CoV-2 outcome after excluding people with previous laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection."

80,"Vaccine effectiveness against deaths was estimated to be 98·1% at 14 days or longer after the second dose and 77·0·% at 14–21 days after the first dose (in contrast to 96·7% at 7 days or longer after the second dose).Incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and prevalence of BNT162b2 vaccination by age group in Israel (Dec 1, 2020, to April 3, 2021)Graphs show the 7-day daily moving average of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and the percentage of the population who had received one and two doses of the vaccine at each time point in people aged 65 years and older (A), 45–64 years (B), 25–44 years (C), and 16–24 years (D).Note that y-axis scales showing infection incidence differ between age groups.Overall, as cumulative vaccination coverage increased, the 7-day daily moving average of incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (per 100 000 people) markedly declined across all age groups (figure 2 ).Notably, steeper and earlier declines were observed in older age groups, which had higher and earlier vaccine coverage.Specifically, although some declines in incident infections were evident around 2 weeks following the implementation of lockdown, sharper declines followed increased vaccine uptake.For example, steep reductions in incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections were observed for people aged 65 years and older starting in mid-January, 2021, but were not observed until 3–4 weeks later among people aged 16–24 years, when vaccine coverage for this age group began to increase.Similar marked declines in all age groups, corresponding to increasing vaccine coverage, were seen in the incidence of COVID-19 hospitalisations, severe or critical hospitalisations, and deaths (appendix pp 6–11).It is also noteworthy that the declines continued even after the two phases of reopening and the final lifting of the lockdown.DiscussionThis nationwide observational study, with a median follow-up period of almost 7 weeks after receipt of the second vaccine dose, showed high effectiveness of two doses of BNT162b2, including among older adults, against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations, severe disease, and deaths.Corroborating the high effectiveness observed, marked declines in incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were observed as vaccine coverage increased.Although population-level vaccine effectiveness data are ecological, and teasing apart the impact of a vaccination programme from the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (including a nationwide lockdown) is complex, it is noteworthy that declines in incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 for each age group corresponded with achieving high vaccine coverage in that age group rather than initiation of the nationwide lockdown.These findings suggest that the primary driver of reductions in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections was high vaccine coverage, not implementation of the lockdown.Furthermore, even after reopenings occurred, SARS-CoV-2 incidence remained low, suggesting that high vaccine coverage might provide a sustainable path towards resuming normal activity.These data provide nationwide evidence of the beneficial public health impact of a COVID-19 vaccination campaign.During the study period, 95% of 8472 tested specimens showed an SGTF, associated with SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7, thereby providing evidence that BNT162b2 is effective against B.1.1.7."
81,"Furthermore, even after reopenings occurred, SARS-CoV-2 incidence remained low, suggesting that high vaccine coverage might provide a sustainable path towards resuming normal activity.These data provide nationwide evidence of the beneficial public health impact of a COVID-19 vaccination campaign.During the study period, 95% of 8472 tested specimens showed an SGTF, associated with SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7, thereby providing evidence that BNT162b2 is effective against B.1.1.7.These findings are consistent with laboratory studies that indicated that BNT162b2 was likely to be effective against B.1.1.7.Notably, another clinically important variant, B.1.351, which was initially identified in South Africa, has recently been identified in Israel.Vaccine effectiveness against B.1.351, however, could not be estimated in our study because of the small number of B.1.351 infections identified in Israel during the study period.This study also suggests that two doses of BNT162b2 are effective against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections (with vaccine effectiveness estimates of 92% at ≥7 days after the second dose and 94% at ≥14 after the second dose).Estimates of effectiveness against asymptomatic infections were slightly lower than those against COVID-19, which could suggest a higher threshold of protection for asymptomatic infection compared with symptomatic illness.We conservatively defined asymptomatic infections as SARS-CoV-2 infections in interviewees who reported no fever and no respiratory symptoms at the time of the interview.Additionally, it is possible that some SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals who reported being asymptomatic at the time of interview might have instead been presymptomatic (ie, developed symptoms later).Although we made efforts to avoid this type of misclassification by excluding the small number of people who were initially reported to be asymptomatic but were later hospitalised for or died from COVID-19, some presymptomatic individuals who later developed symptoms without being hospitalised or dying might still have been included.This type of misclassification, however, was probably uncommon and would be unlikely to substantially influence the vaccine effectiveness estimate against asymptomatic infection.Notably, Israel's SARS-CoV-2 testing policy was different for unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals during the study period.At 7 days after the second dose, vaccinated individuals were exempt from the SARS-CoV-2 testing required of individuals who either had contact with a laboratory-confirmed case or returned from travel abroad.This testing policy might have resulted in a differential bias that would cause overestimation of vaccine effectiveness against asymptomatic infection (ie, asymptomatic people who received two doses were less likely to be tested than unvaccinated asymptomatic people).However, 19% of the 4·4 million PCR tests conducted during the study period were done on exempted individuals (MoH, unpublished data).Additionally, symptomatic individuals might have been reluctant to report symptoms for fear of being blamed for infecting other individuals, in which case asymptomatic vaccine effectiveness would also be overestimated."
82,"However, 19% of the 4·4 million PCR tests conducted during the study period were done on exempted individuals (MoH, unpublished data).Additionally, symptomatic individuals might have been reluctant to report symptoms for fear of being blamed for infecting other individuals, in which case asymptomatic vaccine effectiveness would also be overestimated.Conversely, individuals who were hesitant to receive a COVID-19 vaccine might also have been reluctant to seek SARS-CoV-2 testing, which would lead to underestimation of vaccine effectiveness against asymptomatic infection.Further studies are needed to confirm the magnitude of BNT162b2 protection against asymptomatic infection that we observed.Specifically, studies are needed to evaluate testing behaviour of vaccinated and unvaccinated people and to determine the extent to which prevention of asymptomatic infection leads to interruption of transmission.Two-dose BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness estimates from this observational study align with the 95% efficacy against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections shown in the pivotal RCT.Our study adds important new data about the effectiveness of BNT162b2 derived from outside of the RCT setting.We found high vaccine effectiveness against a wider range of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes (including severe COVID-19 and deaths) than were evaluated in the RCT, as well as high effectiveness in older adults with a level of precision not available in the RCT.In addition, although pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals were excluded from the RCT, these groups were recommended to receive BNT162b2 in Israel and an unknown number would, therefore, have been vaccinated.Finally, unlike the clinical trial, our study provides evidence that achieving high population-level coverage with BNT162b2 can lead to marked declines in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 outcomes.In the primary analysis of the Israel MoH surveillance data, we evaluated the effectiveness of two doses of BNT162b2, given Israel's adherence to the authorised two-dose 21-day vaccine schedule.In the sensitivity analysis, we showed moderate effectiveness of the vaccine against all SARS-CoV-2 outcomes at 14–21 days after the first dose.This finding is similar to those of studies from Israel early in the vaccine campaign and in the UK.Estimated effectiveness against all outcomes at 14–21 days after the first dose was lower than that of two doses at 7 days or longer or at 14 days or longer after the second dose, demonstrating the importance of fully vaccinating adults.Furthermore, despite indications of at least partial effectiveness after one dose of BNT162b2, relying on protection against COVID-19 from a single dose might not be prudent; BNT162b2 was developed and evaluated in the RCT as a two-dose schedule, and substantially lower levels of neutralising antibodies were observed after one dose compared with after two doses."
83,"Estimated effectiveness against all outcomes at 14–21 days after the first dose was lower than that of two doses at 7 days or longer or at 14 days or longer after the second dose, demonstrating the importance of fully vaccinating adults.Furthermore, despite indications of at least partial effectiveness after one dose of BNT162b2, relying on protection against COVID-19 from a single dose might not be prudent; BNT162b2 was developed and evaluated in the RCT as a two-dose schedule, and substantially lower levels of neutralising antibodies were observed after one dose compared with after two doses.Additionally, little is known about the duration of protection of one dose and how it compares with the durability after two doses.It is possible that one dose will provide a shorter duration of protection than two doses, particularly in an environment where new SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge.Our study has some limitations.In the absence of randomisation, there could have been unmeasured differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons (eg, different test-seeking behaviours or levels of adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions) which might have confounded our vaccine effectiveness estimates.Although we adjusted our estimates for age, sex, and calendar week, the effect of additional covariates such as location, comorbidities, race or ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and likelihood of seeking SARS-CoV-2 testing should be evaluated in future studies.Preliminary findings from a study in Israel, for example, indicate that neighbourhood might be an important confounder.Misclassification of exposures and outcomes in our study are potentially more common than in the RCT, although misclassification was probably limited by Israel's readily available SARS-CoV-2 testing and comprehensive surveillance system.Misclassification of vaccine history in our study was also unlikely because of comprehensive recording of vaccine administration in Israel.With nearly 7 weeks of follow-up after the second dose, our study has the longest follow-up reported so far, although longer-term data on effectiveness are needed.Another limitation is that the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation and death might have prevented identification of all hospitalisations and deaths during the study period.Such unidentified hospitalisations and deaths are unlikely, however, to be differential between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.Finally, given differences between countries in how vaccines are rolled out and in how the pandemic evolves, caution should be used in extrapolating our findings to other populations.Further real-world effectiveness studies of BNT162b2, and other COVID-19 vaccines, in other populations and settings are needed.Israel provides a unique opportunity to observe the nationwide impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmission of a rapidly increasing percentage of the population with vaccine-derived immunity.SARS-CoV-2 transmission is likely to continue until the proportion of the population with immunity exceeds a herd immunity threshold, which has been estimated to be at least 60%, although the emergence of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants could result in higher herd immunity thresholds.Achieving the SARS-CoV-2 herd immunity threshold might not be reached, however, without vaccinating some individuals younger than 16 years."
84,"SARS-CoV-2 transmission is likely to continue until the proportion of the population with immunity exceeds a herd immunity threshold, which has been estimated to be at least 60%, although the emergence of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants could result in higher herd immunity thresholds.Achieving the SARS-CoV-2 herd immunity threshold might not be reached, however, without vaccinating some individuals younger than 16 years.In addition, the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, either from infection or immunisation, is not known, and progress towards herd immunity in Israel could be disrupted by the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants if those variants are less susceptible to the current vaccine-induced immune response and if they were to become broadly disseminated.Further studies are needed to monitor the population level of immunity, identify disruption of viral transmission, and detect and evaluate the effects of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.This study showed that two doses of BNT162b2 were highly effective, including in older adults, against laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 hospitalisations, severe disease, and deaths in a nationwide observational study where variant B.1.1.7 was the dominant strain.Marked nationwide declines in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 outcomes corresponded with increasing vaccine coverage, and these declines were sustained even after societal reopening.Finally, the high effectiveness against all SARS-CoV-2 infections and apparent effectiveness against infections that were asymptomatic at the time of epidemiological investigation suggest that BNT162b2 might reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.Taken together, these findings suggest that high vaccine uptake can meaningfully stem the pandemic and offers hope for eventual control of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as vaccination programmes ramp up across the rest of the world.This online publication has been corrected.The corrected version first appeared at thelancet.com on July 15, 2021 Data sharingThe individual-level data used in this study are sensitive and cannot be publicly shared.Requests for data should be made to the Ministry of Health of Israel.Aggregated surveillance data are freely available online at https://data.gov.il/dataset/covid-19.Declaration of interestsFJA, JMM, FK, GM, KP, JS, DLS, and LJ hold stock and stock options in Pfizer."

86,"Relative Mutant N501Y SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein RBD Inhibition of Anti-Spike Protein IgG and ACE-2 Binding to Spike Protein SpeciesThe coronavirus disease outbreak of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a newly emerging coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected more than 110 million people worldwide, resulting in more than 2.4 million deaths (500,000 in the U.S.), little more than 1 year after initial cases appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.It has now become apparent that neutralizing antibodies specific for the viral spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), which binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor on host cells, comprise the critical element of protective immunity to the virus (2).This contention is supported by the finding that the RBD is immunodominant and the target of 90% of the neutralizing activity present in SARS-CoV-2 immune sera (3).The BNT162b2 mRNA and mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, both coding for the spike glycoprotein, developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, respectively, elicit antibodies specific for the RBD and exhibit approximately 95% protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection (4-6).Several mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains have raised concerns regarding increased transmissibility, lethality, and escape from extant immunity, relative to the predominant pandemic strain, D614G, itself a mutant that arose soon after viral spread from Wuhan, China.Most notable of these mutant strains are B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1, which arose in the U.K., South Africa and Brazil, respectively, during late 2020 to early 2021(7-11).The South African variant is of concern, with 21 mutations, including 3 in the RBD, since it has been shown to exhibit reduced neutralization titers, not only against therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, but also COVID-19 convalescent and post-vaccination plasma samples (10-13).Recently, it has been confirmed that these reductions of neutralizing antibody function were sufficient to impair vaccine efficacy appreciably (14).Common to all of the three major variant strains is the RBD mutation N501Y, which signifies a substitution of L-tyrosine for L-asparagine at residue 501 of the spike protein."
87,"The South African variant is of concern, with 21 mutations, including 3 in the RBD, since it has been shown to exhibit reduced neutralization titers, not only against therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, but also COVID-19 convalescent and post-vaccination plasma samples (10-13).Recently, it has been confirmed that these reductions of neutralizing antibody function were sufficient to impair vaccine efficacy appreciably (14).Common to all of the three major variant strains is the RBD mutation N501Y, which signifies a substitution of L-tyrosine for L-asparagine at residue 501 of the spike protein.It has been proposed that a stronger hydrogen bond formed between the mutant residue and the Tyr 41 of the human ACE-2 molecule is responsible for the greater transmissibility of the viral variants (15-18).A laboratory strain of SARS-CoV-2 bearing the Y501 residue, however, did not exhibit decreased neutralizing capacity relative to the N501 strain by 20 post-BNT162b2 vaccination sera (6).We have utilized RBD inhibition of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) developed to measure binding of human IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SP) to test the hypotheses that the N501Y mutation specifically exhibits stronger SP binding to the ACE-2 receptor protein and weaker binding to a monoclonal human antibody raised against the native SP RBD.This is a direct ELISA in which the antigen is adsorbed directly onto microtiter wells, as we previously described for fibrinogen (19).Incubation volumes were 50 µl and all incubations except for the initial coating step were at 37° C. After the blocking step, all incubations were followed by three washes with 0.02 M phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 with 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T).Test wells were coated with 5 µg recombinant spike protein (rSP; S1+S2; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN)/ml coating buffer (0.05 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6) overnight at 4° C. Well contents were aspirated and all wells (including background wells for each sample and standard dilution) were blocked for 1 hour with conjugate buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in 0.05 M Tris, pH 8.0, with 0.02% sodium azide).Human anti-SP IgG standards (chimera, GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) or human ACE-2 Fc (chimera, R&D Systems) in serial dilutions of 500-31.3 ng/ml PBS-T were incubated (n = 6) for 2 hours.All wells were then incubated with 3,000-fold diluted goat anti-human IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 1 hour.The assay was developed by adding substrate buffer (0.05 M glycine buffer, pH 10.5, with 1.5 mM magnesium chloride) to each well, followed by 4 mg paranitrophenylphosphate (PNPP)/ml substrate buffer (for a total volume of 100 µl/well) and incubating for 15 minutes."

After blocking, 0.5 µg RBD-mFc (GenScript)/ml PBS-T was added to all wells and incubated for 2 hours.Human anti-SP IgG standards (in serial dilutions of 500-31.3 ng/ml PBS-T; n = 6) or human ACE-2 Fc (200-25 ng/ml; n = 3) were incubated for 1 hour.The rest of the ELISA protocol was the same as the rSP ELISA.The ODs of PBS-T only wells run in each assay were subtracted from test well ODs.Calculations of standards and sample antibody concentrations, as well as binding affinities, were performed as for the rSP ELISA.A correction nomogram for this ELISA is reproduced in Figure 1B.Human anti-SP IgG or ACE-2 Fc was mixed with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD His tag (R&D Systems) or recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (N501Y)-His tag (Sino Biological, Wayne, PA), both comprising R319-F541 (MW 26 kDa), to produce serial dilutions of 0-500 ng/ml of RBD in the presence of 25 ng/ml of antibody standard for primary incubation following the blocking step of the rSP ELISA.Serial dilutions of 0-250 ng/ml of RBD in the presence of 250 ng/ml of ACE-2 Fc were utilized for secondary incubation of the RBD ELISA."
89,"A correction nomogram for this ELISA is reproduced in Figure 1B.Human anti-SP IgG or ACE-2 Fc was mixed with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD His tag (R&D Systems) or recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (N501Y)-His tag (Sino Biological, Wayne, PA), both comprising R319-F541 (MW 26 kDa), to produce serial dilutions of 0-500 ng/ml of RBD in the presence of 25 ng/ml of antibody standard for primary incubation following the blocking step of the rSP ELISA.Serial dilutions of 0-250 ng/ml of RBD in the presence of 250 ng/ml of ACE-2 Fc were utilized for secondary incubation of the RBD ELISA.IC50 values of inhibition curves were determined by exponential decay regression analysis using SigmaPlot 10 software, as (−0.693)/(-k), where k is the decay constant, expressed as molar concentration.All data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).Significances, especially p < 0.05, were identified as a difference of calculated values.Differences between mean OD values of inhibition curves (p ≤ 0.05) were determined by normal variance analysis (t-test).Composite standard curves for the rSP and RBD ELISAs are shown in Figure 2.Antibody (Ab) standard binding affinity for the spike protein, with correction for post-antibody ELISA incubations (19), was found to be 1.37 ± 0.47 nM (KD)(SD, n = 21).Binding affinity of ACE-2 Fc for the spike protein was found to be 2.16 ± 0.67 nM (n =5), which is similar to published values (2).The corresponding values for the RBD ELISA were 0.55 ± 0.17 nM (n = 17) and 0.72 ± 0.21 nM (n = 3), respectively.Recoveries of IgG antibody standard from pooled normal plasma ranged from 94.5% to 132.5% (mean = 109.7%) from 6.25-100 ng Ab/ml.Inhibition curves of ACE-2 Fc binding to the wild type RBD-mFc by the wild type RBD and the N501Y RBD were virtually identical (Fig.3A).IC50 values were 2.32 nM and 2.52 nM, respectively.The former value was not different from rSP-ACE-2 Fc binding affinity determined by ELISA.Inhibition curves of the anti-SP IgG chimera standard binding to the wild type spike protein (S1 + S2) in the rSP ELISA by the wild type RBD and the N501Y RBD (Fig.3B) were parallel, but different (all points, p < 0.05)."
90,"Inhibition curves of the anti-SP IgG chimera standard binding to the wild type spike protein (S1 + S2) in the rSP ELISA by the wild type RBD and the N501Y RBD (Fig.3B) were parallel, but different (all points, p < 0.05).The IC50 of the former was 20.8 nM, while that of the latter was 13.1 nM, indicating that the affinity of antibody binding to the N501Y RBD was actually nearly twice as great as to the wild type RBD.These data demonstrate that a) the Y501 spike protein does not have greater affinity for the ACE-2 receptor protein than the N501 SP; b) the Y501 spike protein may have an even greater affinity for a human monoclonal antibody specific for the wild type SP than the N501 SP; and c) recombinant RBD inhibition of ligand binding to immobilized spike protein or RBD is a valid approach to assessing the relevant molecular impact of viral mutations.Although there is ample evidence that the B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variant is more transmissible and less reactive with convalescent, post-vaccination, and therapeutic monoclonal neutralizing IgG antibodies than the predominant D614G pandemic strain, it is not at all clear what role the N501Y mutation plays in that shift.Most of the studies showing impaired antibody reactivity involved neutralization of whole virus infectivity in vitro.Neutralization of pseudoviruses engineered to express only the N501 or Y501 residues by 20 post-BNT162b2 vaccination sera was equivalent (6).Pseudoviruses engineered to express the K417N, E484K, N501Y and D614G residues, and to express the full B.1.351 mutations exhibited a 2.7- and 6.4-fold reduction, respectively, in neutralizing titer when compared to a pseudovirus possessing the D614G mutation alone, but retained sufficient neutralizing activity to ensure probable vaccine protection (11).However, dramatic decreases in the efficacy of three COVID-19 vaccines against the South African SARS-CoV-2 variant have been reported (14).Recently, an immunoassay technique was used to measure 1.351 RBD binding to acute, convalescent and post-vaccination plasma IgG antibodies relative to the B1 (wild type) RBD (Edara et al.)(20).Antibody binding magnitude was expressed in arbitrary units relative to a standard provided by the immunoassay manufacturer.Apparently, the 1.351 RBD contained all the mutations, but it is unclear how the protein was produced.Utilizing this approach, these investigators found that antibody binding to the 1.351 RBD was 3-fold lower than to the B1 RBD, which corresponded to a 3.5-fold lower neutralizing titer."
91,"Apparently, the 1.351 RBD contained all the mutations, but it is unclear how the protein was produced.Utilizing this approach, these investigators found that antibody binding to the 1.351 RBD was 3-fold lower than to the B1 RBD, which corresponded to a 3.5-fold lower neutralizing titer.They concluded that this reduction was not sufficient to compromise the protective efficacy of the antibodies.Next to Edara et al., the study reported here is one of the first to reflect direct ligand binding of a mutant RBD, rather than interference with whole virus infectivity.Contrary to expectations, we found no significant difference for the affinity of N501 and Y501 RBD binding to the ACE-2 receptor protein, and the Y501 RBD exhibited nearly twice the affinity for a human monoclonal IgG antibody specific for the wild type RBD as the N501 RBD.It has been speculated that the hydrogen bond between the Y501 residue and the Y41 residue of the ACE-2 protein contributes to an enhanced binding affinity compared to the N501 residue (9, 15, 17, 18).The O-H··N hydrogen bond, however, is stronger than the O-H··O bond, as opposed to the weaker N-H··O bond (21) and, since the N501 residue donates a hydrogen bond to the ACE-2 G352 (17), it is probably the recipient of the hydrogen bond donated by the Y41 residue.On the other hand, the N501-Y41 hydrogen bond is clearly sub-optimally aligned and separated by 3.7 Å, while the N487-Y83 bond is 2.7 Å (15), but it is unlikely that the Y501 mutant residue would be more favorably aligned.In any case, the results of this study support the conclusion that the enhanced binding of the B.1.351 virion to the ACE-2 receptor and its decreased binding affinity for IgG antibodies elicited by the D614G pandemic strain are due to spike protein RBD conformational changes provoked by multiple mutations, rather than the effect of a single mutation.These findings may help to a) implicate the nature of how viral mutations can increase transmissibility and virulence; b) provide an experimental approach to understanding mechanisms of interference with protective immunity; and c) suggest strategies for elucidating these mechanisms.In conclusion, a method has been developed, utilizing validated ELISAs for quantitation of human IgG antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the SP receptor binding domain (RBD), to compare the binding affinities of mutant RBDs for both the ACE-2 receptor protein and human anti-SP IgG antibodies."

93,"Characterization of entry pathways, species-specific ACE2 residues determining entry, and antibody neutralization evasion of Omicron BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3 variantsSince the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) with enhanced transmissibility, ACE2 binding affinity and immune evasive properties have emerged, including the most recent Omicron VOCs.Currently, Omicron (B.1.1.529) is comprised of five main lineages designated BA.1 (and its sublineage BA.1.1), BA.2 (and its sublineage BA.2.12.1), BA.3, BA.4, and BA.5.BA.1 was first identified in November 2021 in Botswana, and it rapidly replaced the then dominant Delta (B.1.617.2) VOC to become globally prevalent due to its enhanced transmissibility and ability to evade antibody neutralization 1–6.By early 2022, an alarming rise of BA.2 was seen in several parts of the world, leading to the replacement of BA.1 and BA.1.1.In comparison to BA.1, BA.2 was demonstrated to have faster replication kinetics, enhanced fusogenicity, and greater pathogenicity in hamsters 7,8.BA.4 and BA.5 are two new lineages that are presently emerging in South Africa.The spike protein of Omicron variants bears an unprecedented degree of antigenic divergence with the highest number of substitutions compared to ancestral B.1 (Wuhan-Hu-1, and D614G) variants and earlier VOCs."
94,"In comparison to BA.1, BA.2 was demonstrated to have faster replication kinetics, enhanced fusogenicity, and greater pathogenicity in hamsters 7,8.BA.4 and BA.5 are two new lineages that are presently emerging in South Africa.The spike protein of Omicron variants bears an unprecedented degree of antigenic divergence with the highest number of substitutions compared to ancestral B.1 (Wuhan-Hu-1, and D614G) variants and earlier VOCs.These include 21 spike substitutions shared by the three main lineages of Omicron in the N-terminal domain (NTD) (G142D), receptor binding domain (RBD) (G339D, S373P, S375F, K417N, N440K, S477N, T478K, E484A, Q493R, Q498R, N501Y, Y505H), and furin cleavage site proximity (D614G, H655Y, N679K, P681H) of the S1 subunit, as well as substitutions in fusion peptide proximity (N764K, D796Y) and heptad repeat region 1 (HR1) (Q954H, N969K) of the S2 subunit (Figure 1).Additionally, 16 unique insertions/deletions/substitutions in BA.1 and 9 unique insertions/substitutions in BA.2 are present.BA.3 shares 10 unique substitutions/deletions with BA.1 and two unique substitutions with BA.2.BA.1.1 differs from BA.1 by one RBD substitution (R346K).Several reports continue to demonstrate total loss of or severely dampened neutralizing activity of serum or plasma obtained from previously convalesced individuals, recipients of two doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech BNT162b2 or Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine, as well as several therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against the BA.1 and BA.2 VOCs 1,3,9–14.A third booster dose of either Pfizer–BioNTech BNT162b2 or Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine, however, recalls and expands preexisting antigen specific memory B cell clones and generates novel B cell clones resulting in enhanced neutralizing antibody titers and breadth towards BA.1 and BA.2 VOCs 15,16.Booster-elicited neutralizing antibody titers remain durable for at least 4 months 17,18.Apart from humans, SARS-CoV-2 was also found to naturally infect diverse domestic and wild animal species, including farm minks 19,20, companion pets (e.g., cats, dogs, ferrets, Syrian hamsters) 21–23, zoo animals (e.g., lions, tigers, cougars, snow leopards, gorillas, otters, and hippopotami) 24, and free ranging white-tailed deer 25."
95,"1 and BA.2 VOCs 15,16.Booster-elicited neutralizing antibody titers remain durable for at least 4 months 17,18.Apart from humans, SARS-CoV-2 was also found to naturally infect diverse domestic and wild animal species, including farm minks 19,20, companion pets (e.g., cats, dogs, ferrets, Syrian hamsters) 21–23, zoo animals (e.g., lions, tigers, cougars, snow leopards, gorillas, otters, and hippopotami) 24, and free ranging white-tailed deer 25.Furthermore, experimental infections in livestock species have determined low-level replication of ancestral variants in cattle 26,27, pigs 28, and sheep 27,29.These observations signify the broad host range of SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of infection by heavily mutated variants to give rise to potential reservoirs that may pose a further risk for spillover back to humans.The primary genetic determinant of SARS-CoV-2 host range is spike interaction with species-specific receptor to allow subsequent viral entry.SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells by interacting with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in a species-specific manner.For instance, ancestral SARS-CoV-2 spike does not interact with murine ACE2, and therefore, human ACE2 (hACE2) transgenic murine models 30–32 or mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 33 were developed to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.The trimeric spike is a class I fusion protein that is cleaved into the S1 and S2 subunits, which are noncovalently associated on the surface of virions.Following the interaction of the RBD (residues 331 to 528) of the S1 subunit with the N-terminus of ACE2 and further proteolytic processing of the S2 subunit at the S2’ site by the host proteases (cathepsin L in endosomes, or TMPRSS2 on the plasma membrane), extensive and irreversible conformational changes occur in the S2 subunit to facilitate membrane fusion.The insertion of S2 fusion peptide in the target cell membrane and the interaction between HR1 and HR2 of the S2 subunit result in the formation of a stable six-helix bundle that brings the viral and cell membranes into proximity for fusion and subsequent viral entry.Here, we report that compared to ancestral D614G, Omicron variants’ (BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, and BA.1.1) infection is less influenced by TMPRSS2, and Omicron variants are therefore relatively more susceptible to endosomal entry inhibition.Additionally, Omicron variants exhibit greater sensitivity to soluble ACE2 (sACE2) inhibition.Furthermore, Omicron variants’ spikes have more efficient usage of ACE2 orthologs from nine diverse animal species than D614G.In addition, we found that Q493R and Q498R substitutions in the Omicron variant spikes promote usage of mouse ACE2 for entry whereas the Q493R substitution prevents usage of Chinese rufous horseshoe bat ACE2."
96,"Furthermore, Omicron variants’ spikes have more efficient usage of ACE2 orthologs from nine diverse animal species than D614G.In addition, we found that Q493R and Q498R substitutions in the Omicron variant spikes promote usage of mouse ACE2 for entry whereas the Q493R substitution prevents usage of Chinese rufous horseshoe bat ACE2.Finally, sera obtained from fully vaccinated (three doses of the Pfizer/BNT162b2 vaccine) individuals and fully vaccinated individuals with a breakthrough infection of Omicron potently neutralize pseudoviruses bearing spike proteins of D614G and Omicron variants.However, neutralization titers against the Omicron variants are 7-8-fold lower compared to D614G.Pseudoviruses bearing spike proteins of BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, and BA.1.1 Omicron variants displayed similar infectivity as D614G in 293T.ACE2 and 293T.ACE2.TMPRSS2 cells (Figure 2A).The presence of TMPRSS2 resulted in a 2.4-14.2-fold enhancement of infection for all the pseudoviruses in 293T.ACE2.TMPRSS2 cells compared to 293T.ACE2 cells.However, D614G pseudovirus infection was greatly enhanced (14.2-fold;p≤0.0001) as observed previously 34, whereas infection of Omicron variants was comparatively less enhanced (2.4-4.9-fold; p≤0.0001) in the presence of TMPRSS2 (Figure 2A and 2B).These findings indicate that TMPRSS2 confers relatively less enhancement of Omicron entry into cells than D614G.Several recent studies showed delayed or attenuated replication of BA.1, BA.2, and BA.1.1 variants compared to B.1 and Delta VOCs in TMPRSS2-expressing cell lines (Calu-3, Caco-2, VeroE6/TMPRSS2) compared to VeroE6 cells, along with higher sensitivity to endosomal inhibitors (Chloroquine, Bafilomycin A) and less sensitivity to TMPRSS2 inhibitor (Camostat mesylate) 6,8,35,36.In cells expressing ACE2 but not TMPRSS2, spike-mediated entry follows the endosomal route, whereas in cells expressing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, spike-mediated entry occurs mainly at the cell surface.We investigated ACE2 preference and TMPRSS2 usage by examining the sensitivity of D614G and the Omicron (BA.1, BA.2, BA.3 and BA.1.1) variant pseudoviruses to endosomal and TMPRSS2 inhibitors, chloroquine and camostat mesylate, respectively."
97,"In cells expressing ACE2 but not TMPRSS2, spike-mediated entry follows the endosomal route, whereas in cells expressing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, spike-mediated entry occurs mainly at the cell surface.We investigated ACE2 preference and TMPRSS2 usage by examining the sensitivity of D614G and the Omicron (BA.1, BA.2, BA.3 and BA.1.1) variant pseudoviruses to endosomal and TMPRSS2 inhibitors, chloroquine and camostat mesylate, respectively.In 293T.ACE2 cells, chloroquine potently inhibited viral entry of both D614G and Omicron variants, but Omicron pseudoviruses were more sensitive to chloroquine (BA.1 IC50:2.06,p<0.001; BA.2 IC50:2.94,p<0.005; BA.3: 2.34,p<0.001; BA.1.1 IC50: 1.85,p<0.002) than D614G (IC50: 5.51) (Figure 2C).No chloroquine inhibition was observed in 293T.ACE2.TMPRSS2 cells (Figure 2D), suggesting that the presence of TMPRSS2 facilitates entry via the cell surface for all variants.D614G (IC50: 0.02) and Omicron (BA.1 IC50: 0.03; BA.2 IC50: 0.01; BA.3: 0.02; BA.1.1 IC50: 0.01) pseudoviruses displayed similar sensitivity to camostat mesylate in 293T.ACE2.TMPRSS2 cells (Figure 2E).These findings indicate greater sensitivity of Omicron pseudoviruses to endosomal entry inhibition compared to D614G.We further investigated ACE2 binding of Omicron variants by analyzing the sensitivity of D614G and Omicron pseudoviruses to soluble human ACE2 (sACE2) in a neutralization assay.Compared to D614G (IC50: 3.31 μg/ml), the BA.1 (IC50: 0.98μg/ml,p<0.0001), BA.2 (IC50: 0.99 μg/ml, p<0.0004) and BA.1.1 (IC50: 0.99 μg/ml, p<0.0005) variants demonstrated approximately 3-fold greater sensitivity to sACE2 whereas the BA.3 variant (IC50: 1.85 μg/ml, p<0.0005) showed 1.75-fold greater sensitivity to sACE2 (Figure 3).The sACE2 IC50 values reported here are comparable to previously reported values for D614G and BA.1 37.Pre-incubation of viruses at different temperatures can reveal differences in the stability of the viral glycoprotein trimers, including SARS-CoV-2 37,38."
98,"Compared to D614G (IC50: 3.31 μg/ml), the BA.1 (IC50: 0.98μg/ml,p<0.0001), BA.2 (IC50: 0.99 μg/ml, p<0.0004) and BA.1.1 (IC50: 0.99 μg/ml, p<0.0005) variants demonstrated approximately 3-fold greater sensitivity to sACE2 whereas the BA.3 variant (IC50: 1.85 μg/ml, p<0.0005) showed 1.75-fold greater sensitivity to sACE2 (Figure 3).The sACE2 IC50 values reported here are comparable to previously reported values for D614G and BA.1 37.Pre-incubation of viruses at different temperatures can reveal differences in the stability of the viral glycoprotein trimers, including SARS-CoV-2 37,38.We evaluated the effect of temperature on spike glycoprotein stability, and thus infectivity, by incubating D614G and Omicron variants pseudoviruses at 4°C, 25°C (room temperature or RT), 32°C, 37°C, 42°C and 50°C for an hour or 50°C for various periods of time before measuring their infectivity on 293T.ACE2 and 293T.ACE2.TMPRSS2 cells.We observed no significant differences in the infectivity of D614G and Omicron variants pseudoviruses after incubation at 4°C, RT, 32°C, 37°C, and 42°C (Figure 4).All viruses were relatively stable at 4°C, RT, 32°C, 37°C, and 42°C.Our findings are in agreement with a previous study where no differences in infectivity were observed between VSV-pseudotyped D614G and BA.1 VOC pseudoviruses upon extended incubation (72hrs) at 4°C, RT, and 37°C 37.However, infectivity of all pseudoviruses dramatically declined upon incubation at 50°C with no significant difference between D614G and Omicron variants pseudoviruses (Figure 4).Substitutions in the RBD have been linked to SARS-CoV-2 adaptation to new hosts, such as ferrets 39, mouse 33, mink 40 and white-tailed deer 41.The ongoing dominance and circulation of Omicron VOCs pose a significant risk for reverse zoonosis and spill back into the humans.Therefore, we investigated the ability of the Omicron (BA.1, BA.2, BA.3 and BA.1.1) variants to use ACE2 orthologs from ten diverse host species including African green monkey, Chinese rufous horseshoe bat, ferret, mouse, Chinese hamster, Syrian golden hamster, white-tailed deer, swine, bovine, and Malayan pangolin.293T cells transiently transfected with ACE2 receptors of each species were infected with pseudoviruses bearing spike proteins of D614G and the Omicron variants.We found that D614G pseudoviruses infected cells expressing ACE2 receptors of all the species well above the background except mouse, consistent with prior studies 3,33,42 (Figure 5A).Conversely, ACE2 receptors of all species, except horseshoe bat, supported infection by Omicron pseudoviruses (Figure 5B-E).293T cells with stable expression of human ACE2 (293T.ACE2) were used as a positive control."
99,"Conversely, ACE2 receptors of all species, except horseshoe bat, supported infection by Omicron pseudoviruses (Figure 5B-E).293T cells with stable expression of human ACE2 (293T.ACE2) were used as a positive control.We confirmed robust ACE2 expression for each species via Western blotting using the V5 tag at the C-terminus of these ACE2 proteins (Supplementary Figure 1).The Omicron pseudoviruses had significantly higher levels of infection than D614G pseudoviruses in cells expressing African green monkey, Chinese rufous horseshoe bat, ferret, mouse, Chinese hamster, Syrian golden hamster, white-tailed deer (save BA.1), swine, and bovine ACE2 receptors (Table 1).No significant difference between D614G and Omicron variants was observed with respect to Malayan pangolin ACE2 (Table 1).These findings indicate that the receptor binding motif (RBM) substitutions in the Omicron (BA.1, BA.2, BA.3 and BA.1.1) variants can modulate ACE2 receptor usage and therefore, Omicron variants’ entry.We next investigated the residues in D614G and Omicron spikes that allow or prevent infection of cells expressing horseshoe bat and mouse ACE2, respectively.Crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complexes show the ACE2 N-terminal helix cradled in the ridged concave surface formed by the spike RBM 43–46.Seventeen RBM residues contact ACE2 residues in its N terminus (Table 2).Among wild type SARS-CoV-2 RBM residues, Q498 interacts with D38, Y41, Q42, L45, and K353 residues of ACE2, while Q493 interacts with K31, H34, and E35 of ACE2, forming a network of hydrogen bonds 43–46.Structural and computational determination of Omicron RBD-ACE2 interactions revealed Q493R forming a new salt bridge with E35 while disrupting previous interactions of Q493 with K31 observed in wild type.The Q498R substitution also forms a new hydrogen bond and a salt bridge with ACE2 D38 and Q42 47–49.We assessed whether Q493R and Q498R substitutions in the RBM of Omicron spike facilitate entry of Omicron pseudoviruses in cells expressing mouse ACE2, or conversely, confer resistance to entry of cells expressing horseshoe bat ACE2.Pseudoviruses bearing Q493R and Q498R substitutions on the D614G background spike were therefore generated to infect 293T cells expressing ACE2 proteins of all the species described above."
100,"We assessed whether Q493R and Q498R substitutions in the RBM of Omicron spike facilitate entry of Omicron pseudoviruses in cells expressing mouse ACE2, or conversely, confer resistance to entry of cells expressing horseshoe bat ACE2.Pseudoviruses bearing Q493R and Q498R substitutions on the D614G background spike were therefore generated to infect 293T cells expressing ACE2 proteins of all the species described above.As expected, the Q493R substitution rescued pseudovirus infection in cells expressing mouse ACE2, but reduced pseudovirus infection in cells expressing horseshoe bat ACE2 to background levels (Table 1) (Figure 5F).The Q498R substitution also rescued infection in cells expressing mouse ACE2 above the background but had no effect on cells expressing horseshoe bat ACE2 (Table 1) (Figure 5G).As controls, the Omicron non-RBM S373P and mink adapted Y453F substitutions had no effect on pseudovirus entry in cells expressing mouse ACE2 or horseshoe bat ACE2 (Table 1) (Figure 5H and 5I).It is likely that the Q493R basic substitution in Omicron VOCs forms a salt bridge with the acidic E35 residue of mouse ACE2 or disrupts interaction with the basic K35 residue of horseshoe bat ACE2, thus facilitating or preventing infection of cells expressing mouse ACE2 and horseshoe bat ACE2 respectively (Table 2) (Figure 5J, 5K).Alternatively, the K35 residue in horseshoe bat ACE2 interacts with Q493 residue in D614G spike (Figure 5L).On the other hand, substitutions similar to Q498R were previously observed in mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (Q498H, Q498Y/P499T) to strengthen interaction with D38 of mouse ACE2, which otherwise forms an intramolecular salt bridge with H353 50–52 (Table 2) (Figure 5M).The interactions between R498 in Omicron spike and D38 and H353 in mouse ACE2 likely plays an important role for infection.For the remaining species, S373P, Y453F, Q493R, and Q498R substitutions phenocopied D614G in ACE2 usage (Figure 5F-5I).The Q493R substitution significantly enhanced the usage of all the remainder species, highlighting the role played by this substitution in enhancing ACE2 usage of Omicron variants, as described above (Figure 5F, Table 1).While S373P and Q498R substitutions had no significant effect compared to D614G, the mink-adapted Y453F substitution led to enhanced usage of African green monkey, ferret, Chinese hamster, Syrian golden hamster, white-tailed deer, and swine ACE2 receptors."
101,"The Q493R substitution significantly enhanced the usage of all the remainder species, highlighting the role played by this substitution in enhancing ACE2 usage of Omicron variants, as described above (Figure 5F, Table 1).While S373P and Q498R substitutions had no significant effect compared to D614G, the mink-adapted Y453F substitution led to enhanced usage of African green monkey, ferret, Chinese hamster, Syrian golden hamster, white-tailed deer, and swine ACE2 receptors.A previous report has indicated the Y453F substitution enhanced spike interaction with Mustela species ACE2 orthologs, including minks, ferrets and stouts, while not compromising human ACE2 usage (Figure 5I, Table 1) 40.Our findings extend this report and provide further insights into the effect of Y453F substitution for other species’ ACE2.We next evaluated the serum neutralizing activity in serum from vaccinated individuals who received three immunizations (two dose primary vaccine series and a third dose of booster) of the Pfizer/BNT162b2 vaccine.Receipt of a booster dose elicited significantly higher neutralization titers against D614G (GMT:7527) than two dose primary vaccine series, as seen previously 53.Furthermore, all serum samples had neutralizing activity against Omicron pseudoviruses after the receipt of a third booster dose.Neutralization titers against BA.1 (GMT:1087), BA.2 (GMT:961), BA.3 (GMT:916), and BA.1.1 (GMT:916) pseudoviruses were significantly reduced, 6.6-fold (p≤0.05), 7.8-fold (p≤0.0005), 8.2-fold (p≤0.0001), and 7.7-fold (p<0.0005) respectively, compared to D614G (GMT:7527) (Figure 6A).For two of the vaccinated individuals described above, we obtained serum samples one week prior to a third booster dose, as well as three weeks after the third booster.Therefore, we compared neutralization activity before and after the booster dose (pre- and post-boost respectively).We found 45.2-64.5-fold enhancement in post-boost neutralization titer compared to pre-boost titer for D614G and Omicron VOCs (Figure 6B).We also evaluated convalescent sera from five vaccinated individuals who experienced breakthrough infection post boost, when BA.1 or BA.1.1 variants were predominant (December 2021-January 2022).Serum samples from all individuals had the highest neutralization activity against D614G pseudoviruses (GMT: 16270) followed by lower neutralization against BA.1 (GMT: 6204), BA.2 (GMT: 3906), BA.3 (GMT: 5407) and BA.1.1 (GMT: 5873) variant pseudoviruses (Figure 6C)."
102,"We found 45.2-64.5-fold enhancement in post-boost neutralization titer compared to pre-boost titer for D614G and Omicron VOCs (Figure 6B).We also evaluated convalescent sera from five vaccinated individuals who experienced breakthrough infection post boost, when BA.1 or BA.1.1 variants were predominant (December 2021-January 2022).Serum samples from all individuals had the highest neutralization activity against D614G pseudoviruses (GMT: 16270) followed by lower neutralization against BA.1 (GMT: 6204), BA.2 (GMT: 3906), BA.3 (GMT: 5407) and BA.1.1 (GMT: 5873) variant pseudoviruses (Figure 6C).Although the sample size is small, the results show similar resistance trends among these Omicron variants compared to D614G.In the present study we compared four Omicron lineage (BA.1, BA.2, BA.3 and BA.1.1) variants spikes for their ability to mediate virus entry in cells expressing human ACE2 in the presence or absence of TMPRSS2 and in cells expressing ACE2 orthologs of different species.We also assessed neutralization sensitivity of these spikes by soluble ACE2 and vaccine-elicited antibodies.We found that TMPRSS2 enhances Omicron (BA.1, BA.2, BA.3 and BA.1.1) pseudovirus infection relatively less than the B.1 (D614G) pseudovirus.In addition, compared to D614G, all Omicron lineage spikes more efficiently used ACE2 receptors from diverse animal species including mouse ACE2 but not horseshoe bat ACE2 for entry.Finally, we also observed that three doses of the Pfizer/BNT162b2 vaccine induced antibodies that had comparable levels of neutralization towards BA.1, BA.2, BA.3 and BA.1.1 Omicron lineages, although the neutralization titers against Omicron are 7-8-fold lower than those against D614G.Several recent studies demonstrated less enhancement of virus entry by TMPRSS2 for BA.1 pseudovirus infection compared to D614G and Delta pseudoviruses in ACE2/TMPRSS2-expressing cell lines (Calu3, Caco2, VeroE6/TMPRSS2), while no infection differences were observed in cell lines expressing ACE2 but not TMPRSS2 (VeroE6, H1299, HeLa-, HEK293T- and A549-ACE2) 6,54,55.Similar observations were reported in studies that performed authentic SARS-CoV-2 infections 6,54,55.Compared to D614G or the Delta VOC, Omicron variants (BA.1, BA.1.1) had attenuated or inefficient replication in TMPRSS2-positive lower airway or gall bladder organoids, Calu3, and Caco2 lung cell lines, but had no significant difference in cells with low or no TMPRSS2 expression (H1299, HeLa- and 293T-ACE2 cells) 6,36,55."
103,"Similar observations were reported in studies that performed authentic SARS-CoV-2 infections 6,54,55.Compared to D614G or the Delta VOC, Omicron variants (BA.1, BA.1.1) had attenuated or inefficient replication in TMPRSS2-positive lower airway or gall bladder organoids, Calu3, and Caco2 lung cell lines, but had no significant difference in cells with low or no TMPRSS2 expression (H1299, HeLa- and 293T-ACE2 cells) 6,36,55.Due to apparently less efficient use of TMPRSS2, Omicron variants appear to favor endocytic route of entry rather than TMPRSS2-mediated entry at the cell surface and consequently are more sensitive to endosomal inhibitors (chloroquine, bafilomycin A1 and E64d) 6,35.Our findings are consistent with the increased use of the endosomal entry pathway in cells expressing only ACE2, though we found that coexpression of TMPRSS2 enhanced infection.A possible mechanism that contributes to less efficient TMPRSS2 utilization by Omicron VOCs is the accumulation of multiple additional basic amino acid substitutions, leading to an overall positively charged Omicron spike proteins compared to the D614G spike.These substitutions may confer greater sensitivity to low pH-induced conformational changes in endosomes, and therefore be better adapted for entry in the low pH environment encountered in the upper airway 6.In this regard, a recent preprint showed greater sensitivity of Omicron (BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4) pseudoviruses to endosomal (E64d) entry inhibition compared to pseudoviruses with D614G and Delta VOC spikes, but refractory to Camostat inhibition in Caco-2 cells where both endosomal and TMPRSS2-mediated cell surface entry routes are active 56.This phenotype is accounted for by the N969K S2 substitution in Omicron VOCs 56.However, maximum likelihood fitting models comparing the entry routes of Omicron suggest that Omicron is also efficient in utilizing TMPRSS2 for entry into human nasal epithelial cells 56.Alternatively, the BA.1 spike protein was shown to be less efficiently cleaved at the S1/S2 site compared to wild type and Delta VOC in authentic SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, as well as on virions 6,7,36,55.Efficient cleavage at the S1/S2 site is known to be required for exposure of the S2’ site for TMPRSS2 processing after ACE2 binding.Substitutions proximal to the furin cleavage site (H655Y, N679K and P681H), as well as substitutions in the S2 subunit, may contribute to less efficient TMPRSS2 cleavage of Omicron spike 36.Finally, higher affinities of BA.1 (6-fold) and BA.2 (11-fold) RBD for ACE2 coupled with transitions into the so called two- or three-RBD-up conformations may also contribute to the efficient use of ACE2 48,57."

111,"A prospective observational study for justification, safety, and efficacy of a third dose of mRNA vaccine in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysisThe level of protection achieved by the standard two doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) remains unclear.To study this we used the French Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (REIN) Registry to compare the incidence and severity of 1474 cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in patients receiving MHD after none, one or two doses of vaccine.Vaccination significantly reduce COVID-19 incidence and severity, but 11% of patients infected after two doses still died.Lack of vaccinal protection in patients naive for SARS-CoV-2 could be due to defective Tfh response [38% of patients with negative spike-specific CD4+ T-cell interferon gamma release assay] and failure to generate viral neutralizing titers of anti-spike receptor binding domain (RBD) IgGs (63% of patients with titer at or under 997 BAU/ml, defining low/no responders) after two doses of vaccine.To improve protection, a third dose of vaccine was administered to 75 patients [57 low/no responders, 18 high responders after two doses] from the ROMANOV cohort that prospectively enrolled patients receiving MHD vaccinated with BNT162b2 (Pfizer).Tolerance to the third dose was excellent.High responders to two doses did not generate more anti-RBD IgGs after three doses but had more side effects.Importantly, 31 (54%) of low/no responders to two doses reached neutralizing titers of anti-RBD IgGs after three doses.A positive interferon gamma release assay and/or suboptimal titer of anti-RBD IgGs after two doses were the only predictive variables for response to three doses in multivariate analysis.Thus, the standard scheme of vaccination insufficiently protects patients receiving MHD.Anti-RBD IgG and specific CD4+ T-cell response after two doses can guide personalized administration of the third dose, which improves the humoral response of SARS-CoV-2-naive patients receiving MHD.Graphical abstractAmong the various alarms raised by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was its impact on the population of patients with end-stage renal disease,   particularly those requiring in-center hemodialysis."
112,"Thus, the standard scheme of vaccination insufficiently protects patients receiving MHD.Anti-RBD IgG and specific CD4+ T-cell response after two doses can guide personalized administration of the third dose, which improves the humoral response of SARS-CoV-2-naive patients receiving MHD.Graphical abstractAmong the various alarms raised by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was its impact on the population of patients with end-stage renal disease,   particularly those requiring in-center hemodialysis.The logistical aspects of the technique indeed increase the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, which on the highly comorbid profile of patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) then translates into a high rate of COVID-19-related death.Aiming at protecting this vulnerable population, French health authorities prioritized patients on MHD for vaccination.However, while 2 doses (2Ds) administered i.m.3 weeks apart of BNT162b2, a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine, induced both strong humoral and cellular immune responses against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in the general population, our group and others have recently reported that patients on MHD, particularly those that were naive for SARS-CoV-2, generated weaker responses than did healthy volunteers after this ""standard"" scheme of vaccination, raising questions about the actual level of protection provided by the vaccine.The prospective observational Response of Hemodialyzed Patients to COVID-19 Vaccination (ROMANOV-II) study compared the severity of COVID-19 disease in patients on MHD according to their vaccination status and at evaluated whether a third dose (3D) of BNT162b2 vaccine was safe and efficient to increase the generation of immune effectors.MethodsEpidemiologic studyThe Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (REIN) is the French national registry of all patients being treated by renal replacement therapy.Clinical, demographic, and laboratory data are collected at the start of renal replacement therapy along with dialysis modalities and are updated annually.Events such as death, transfer, withdrawal from dialysis, placement on a transplant waiting list, and kidney transplantation (from living or deceased donors), as well as COVID-19 diagnosis and severity are systematically reported in real time."
113,"Clinical, demographic, and laboratory data are collected at the start of renal replacement therapy along with dialysis modalities and are updated annually.Events such as death, transfer, withdrawal from dialysis, placement on a transplant waiting list, and kidney transplantation (from living or deceased donors), as well as COVID-19 diagnosis and severity are systematically reported in real time.Interrogation of the REIN registry was made on June 18, 2021, on the period from the February 1 to May 18, 2021.To estimate the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in patients on MHD, data from the REIN registry were cross-referenced with those of the Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie (CNAM), which collects each week the cumulative number of patients on MHD that had received their first and second doses of mRNA vaccine.Because protection of a vaccine dose was previously reported to be efficient from the 10th day following injection onward, patients were considered as ""not vaccinated"" until the 10th day after the first dose and remained in the group ""1 dose of vaccine"" until the 10th day after the second dose.Severity of COVID-19 was graded as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, critical, or death following the World Health Organization's recommendations.The ROMANOV-II prospective observational studyIn line with the French health authority's recommendations, a third vaccine injection of mRNA BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine was proposed to all patients on MHD in the 2 centers of Lyon University Hospital who already received 2Ds of mRNA BNT162b2 and did not have any of the following contraindications: diagnosis of COVID-19 within the last 3 months, organ transplantation within the last 3 months, rituximab injection within the last 3 months, ongoing flare of vasculitis, acute sepsis, or major surgery within the last 2 weeks.Before the third injection, patients were informed of their serological status after 2Ds.History of COVID-19 was defined as a positive polymerase chain reaction test in nasopharyngeal swab.The screening for infection was performed in patients in the presence of symptoms or because the patient had contact with a positive case.The same detection strategy was applied to patients on MHD and healthy volunteers (HVs).All adult patients who received a third vaccine injection (within 3 months after the second vaccine injection) with BNT162b2 vaccine and who gave consent for the use of their blood were enrolled in this study.The samples were collected 10 to 14 days after the second and after the third vaccine injection for analysis of the postvaccinal immune response.This timing was selected based on previous reports demonstrating that both cellular and antibody responses are at their peak at this time point."

Virus stock was quantified by classic limiting dilution plaque assay on Vero E6 cells (kindly provided by Dr. F-L. Cosset, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie-Lyon).Two-fold dilutions of serum in 50 mul of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 2x penicillin/streptomycin, were incubated with 200 plaque-forming units of SARS-CoV-2 in 50 mul of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 15 minutes at room temperature.Aliquots of 100 mul of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 4% fetal bovine serum containing 2.5 x 104 Vero E6 cells were added to achieve a final dilution of sera from 1:100 to 1:12,800 (4 wells per dilution).Cells were incubated for 5 days at 37  C, 5% CO2.After 15 minutes of fixation in paraformaldehyde 4% in phosphate buffered saline 1x, cytopathic effect was revealed by crystal violet staining and scored by a researcher (CM) blinded to the study design and sample identity."

P = 0.054) and a positive spike-specific CD4+ T-cell IGRA (odds ratio: 9.25 [95% confidence interval: 2.44-40.7]; P = 0.002) after 2Ds (Figure 5g).Furthermore, combining this information, we observed that the probability to respond to the 3D in patients on MHD that were low or no responders to 2Ds was the highest in patients positive for both tests (82%) (Figure 5h).The response rate decreased to 41% in patients on MHD with only low anti-RBD IgG after the 2D and dropped to 0% in those in whom both tests were negative after the 2D (Figure 5h).DiscussionThis prospective observational study demonstrates that, in contrast with what reported in the general population, the ""standard"" 2D scheme with BNT162b2 vaccine provides insufficient protection against the severe forms of COVID-19 in patients on MHD who are naive for the virus.This problem could be due to the fact that patients on MHD develop a flawed humoral response after 2Ds of vaccine, as illustrated by the very limited viral neutralizing capacity of their serum as compared with that of HVs.This could be the consequence of the deleterious impact of uremic toxins   on the generation of spike-specific Tfh cells, a crucial subset to generate high titer of IgGs that was detected in reduced number in patients on MHD who fail to respond to the vaccination.These conclusions are in line with recent studies that reported that patients on MHD who are naive for SARS-CoV-2 develop impaired humoral and cellular immune responses after 2Ds of BNT162b2.Based on the observations that (i) patients on MHD with a previous history of COVID-19 had a response to vaccine indistinguishable from that of HVs, and (ii) previous studies with protein-based vaccine (such as hepatitis B vaccine) reported acceptable response rates when dosing and/or number of administrations were increased, a 3D of BNT162b2 vaccine was offered to patients on MHD in France."

135,"SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein D614G mutation increases virion spike density and infectivitySARS-CoV-2 variants with spike (S)-protein D614G mutations now predominate globally.We therefore compare the properties of the mutated S protein (SG614) with the original (SD614).We report here pseudoviruses carrying SG614 enter ACE2-expressing cells more efficiently than those with SD614.This increased entry correlates with less S1-domain shedding and higher S-protein incorporation into the virion.Similar results are obtained with virus-like particles produced with SARS-CoV-2 M, N, E, and S proteins.However, D614G does not alter S-protein binding to ACE2 or neutralization sensitivity of pseudoviruses.Thus, D614G may increase infectivity by assembling more functional S protein into the virion.SARS-CoV-2 variants with spike (S)-protein D614G mutations currently predominate globally.Here, Zhang et al.hypothesize that D614G variant may increase infectivity by increasing S protein abundance on the virion since pseudoviruses carrying S-G614 incorporate higher amounts of S protein and enter cells more efficiently than those carrying S-D614.IntroductionUntil late 2019, only six coronaviruses were known to infect humans: HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), HCoV-NL63, CoV-HKU1, and MERS-CoV.A seventh human coronavirus, i.e., SARS-CoV-2 detected in late 2019 is closely related to SARS-CoV-1 that emerged in the winter of 2002/2003.The coronavirus spike (S) protein mediates receptor binding and fusion of the viral and cellular membrane.The S protein extends from the viral membrane and is uniformly distributed as trimers on the virion surface to give the appearance of a crown (corona in Latin).The coronavirus S protein is divided into two domains: S1 and S2.The S1 domain mediates receptor binding and the S2 mediates downstream membrane fusion.The receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a metalloprotease that also serves as the receptor for SARS-CoV-1.A small, independently folded subdomain of S1, described as the receptor-binding domain (RBD), directly binds ACE2 when the virus engages a target cell."

139,"1f).The enhanced entry of PVG614 into hACE2-293T and lung epithelial cells is not an artifact of differences in PV production, as the yields of PVs measured by RT-qPCR were similar (Supplementary Figs.1a, b and 3a).Nor it is the result of differential expression of SD614 and SG614, because the expression of total S protein measured by western blot (WB) in cell lysates and by flow cytometry in transfected cells shows comparable levels for SD614 and SG614 (Supplementary Fig.4a, b).Together, these data show that PVG614 mediates more efficient entry into ACE2-expressing cells than does PVD614.Superior infectivity of PVG614 is associated with decreased S1 shedding and higher S-protein density in the virionSuperior infectivity of PVG614 is associated with decreased S1 shedding and higher level of S protein in the virion.a–f Indicated MLV PVs produced with the S protein containing the FLAG tag at both the N- and C-termini were purified by pelleting through a 20% sucrose layer.PV yields were assessed by RT-qPCR (a).The same symbols in different PV groups indicate they are from the same batch.The same PVs were assessed for their infectivity in Mock and hACE2-293T cells (b).Mean ± SEM of n = 3 biologically independent PV batches (a) and n = 4 experiments using those three PV batches (b) are shown.The same amount (1 × 1010 vg per lane) (c, d) or different amounts to more accurately compare the S1 and S2 ratio (e, f) of the purified PVs were analyzed by WB (western blot) using the anti-FLAG M2 antibody or anti-p30 MLV gag antibody.The same PVs visualized by silver stain are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5.Total virion S protein (d) and the S1:S2 ratio (f) of PVD614 and PVG614 were calculated from n = 4 (d) or n = 5 (f) WBs performed with three independently prepared PV batches and presented as mean ± SEM.The p values by one-way ANOVA (a), two-way ANOVA with Sidak multiple comparison tests of log-transformed data (b), or two-sided unpaired Student’s t-test (d, f) are indicated.GFP green fluorescent protein, MLV Maloney murine leukemia virus, PV pseudovirus, FKO furin-cleavage knockout mutant, M.F.I.mean fluorescence intensity.We next investigated the mechanism with which the D614G mutation increased entry of PVG614."

141,"We also directly visualized virion S-protein bands by silver staining (Supplementary Fig. 5).Although S2 bands are masked by an MLV protein of a similar size, S1 bands are well separated.Again, the intensity of the S1 band of PVG614 is much stronger than that of PVD614, while the p30 bands are comparable, a result consistent with those observed using the anti-FLAG M2 antibody.SARS-CoV-2 VLPG614 and lung epithelial cell-produced PVG614 also exhibit decreased S1 shedding and increased total virion S proteinSARS-CoV-2 VLPG614 and lung epithelial cell-produced PVG614 also exhibit decreased S1 shedding and increased total virion S protein.a–f PVs produced from NCI-H1299, a lung epithelial cell line (a–c), and VLPs (virus-like particles) produced from HEK293T cells by transfecting M, N, E, and S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (d–f) are analyzed.The S protein is FLAG tagged at both the N- and C-termini.PVs were harvested at 48 h and VLPs at 43 h and purified by pelleting through a 20% sucrose layer.The S protein bands were visualized using the anti-FLAG tag M2 antibody (a, d), p30 band with an anti-p30 antibody (a), and the N protein band using pooled convalescent plasma (d).Representative images of WBs (western blot) performed with n = 4 independently prepared PV (a) or VLP (d) batches are shown.The S1:S2 ratio and the difference in total virion S protein incorporation are presented as mean ± SEM, which were calculated from those four PV WBs (b,c) or four VLP WBs (e,f).The p values by two-sided unpaired Student’s t-test are indicated (b, c, e, f).MLV Maloney murine leukemia virus, PV pseudovirus, FKO furin-cleavage knockout mutant.We then explored whether the properties of SG614 could be observed when PVs were produced from the lung epithelial cells, emulating SARS-CoV-2 infection of the lung.To produce sufficient amount of PVs, we screened transfection efficiencies of several lung and gastrointestinal epithelial cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 6).Of these, only NCI-H1299 cells were amenable to transfection with low but usable PV yield.Surprisingly, although most SARS-CoV-2 target cells in the lung epithelium in vivo are enriched with furin, these cells had little or no furin activity (Supplementary Fig. 6).We thus cotransfected a small amount of furin during PV production in NCI-H1299 cells."
142,"Surprisingly, although most SARS-CoV-2 target cells in the lung epithelium in vivo are enriched with furin, these cells had little or no furin activity (Supplementary Fig. 6).We thus cotransfected a small amount of furin during PV production in NCI-H1299 cells.These PVs exhibited similar phenotypes as those derived from HEK293T cells (Fig. 3a–c).Thus, as with HEK293T cells, PVs made in a lung epithelial cell line more efficiently incorporated functional SG614 compared to SD614.To verify that these observations were not due to properties of retroviral particles, we repeated these studies with virus-like particles (VLPs) composed only of native SARS-CoV-2 proteins, specifically nucleoprotein (N), membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E), and S protein.VLPs were purified and analyzed in the same way as MLV PVs.S-protein bands were detected with the anti-FLAG M2 antibody, and N protein with pooled plasma derived from convalescent COVID-19 patients.As with PVs, the S1:S2 ratio and total S protein on the virion were again much higher in the VLPs carrying SG614 (VLPG614) compared to those carrying SD614 (VLPD614) (Fig. 3d–f).Thus, enhanced entry of PV containing the D614G mutation correlates with reduced shedding of the S1 domain and greater incorporation of functional spikes into the virion.To exclude an artifact associated with S-protein tags, we similarly characterized untagged S proteins (Supplementary Fig. 7).Again greater virion incorporation of S protein and higher ratios of S1 to S2 were observed with PVG614 compared with PVD614.We next asked if higher stability of PVG614 spikes correlated with slower loss of PV infectivity over time.PVs left at room temperature for up to 48 h were used in hACE2-293T entry assays.Under these conditions, we observed no difference in the rate of inactivation among PVD614, PVG614, or PVFKO (Supplementary Fig.8a), indicating that loss of infectivity by these PVs is attributed to factors other than differences in their S proteins.This unexpected result suggested the possibility that most S1-domain shedding from SD614 occurs before the test period.To evaluate this possibility, we purified PVs from intracellular compartments and observed that S1 shedding had already taken place (Supplementary Fig. 8b)."
143,"This unexpected result suggested the possibility that most S1-domain shedding from SD614 occurs before the test period.To evaluate this possibility, we purified PVs from intracellular compartments and observed that S1 shedding had already taken place (Supplementary Fig. 8b).These data show that low stability of SD614 did not accelerate PVD614 inactivation, because most S1 shedding occurred prior to PV release from the cell.The D614G mutation neither increases S protein affinity for ACE2 nor makes PV more resistant to neutralizationThe D614G mutation neither increases S protein affinity for ACE2 nor makes PV more resistant to neutralization.a The S protein containing C-terminal FLAG tag is transfected into HEK293T cells and assessed for hACE2-NN-Ig binding.Total S protein was measured by detecting the FLAG tag in the permeabilized cells.The ratio of hACE2-NN-Ig binding to FLAG-tag staining is shown.b Experiments similar to those in a except that the S protein contains N-Myc and C-FLAG tags, and S1 level was assessed using an anti-Myc antibody.The data in a,b before normalization are presented in Supplementary Fig.9a, b.Mean ± SEM of n = 3 independent experiments are shown.The p values by one-way ANOVA and Sidak multiple comparisons test are indicated.c Surface plasmon resonance assay design (left) and sensorgrams (middle and right).S1-Fc was immobilized and monomeric hACE2-NN-Ctag was injected at 500, 250, 125, 62.5, and 31.25 nM.Colored lines are the experimental traces and black lines are the best global fits (1:1 Langmuir binding model) used to calculate the association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate constants.Representative sensorgrams of three independent experiments with nearly identical results are shown.Supplementary Fig.9c shows the proteins used in these assays and Fig.9d presents kon, koff, and KD values derived from n = 3 independent experiments.d MLV PVs pseudotyped with the indicated S protein (C-term FLAG) or VSV G protein were preincubated without (presented at x = −6) or with serially diluted convalescent or control plasmas.hACE2-293T cells were incubated with these preincubated mixes and analyzed 24 h later by measuring luciferase activity.Mean ± SEM of n = 3 independent experiments are presented.FKO furin-cleavage knockout mutant.It has previously been speculated that D614G mutation promotes an open configuration of the S protein that is more favorable to ACE2 association.To explore this possibility, we investigated whether ACE2 binding to SG614-spikes, S-protein trimers, was more efficient than to SD614-spikes."
144,"FKO furin-cleavage knockout mutant.It has previously been speculated that D614G mutation promotes an open configuration of the S protein that is more favorable to ACE2 association.To explore this possibility, we investigated whether ACE2 binding to SG614-spikes, S-protein trimers, was more efficient than to SD614-spikes.HEK293T cells transfected to express each of these S proteins were assessed for their binding of hACE2 immunoadhesin, whose enzymatic activity was abolished by mutation (hACE2-NN-Ig).We previously showed hACE2-NN-Ig bound SARS-CoV-1 RBD with an equivalent affinity as hACE2-Ig.The S proteins used in this study are fused to the FLAG tag at the C-terminus, but not at the N-terminus, thus allowing for the measurement of total S protein expression with an anti-FLAG antibody.As Supplementary Fig.9a shows, total expression of SD614, SG614, and SFKO, assessed by FLAG-tag staining of permeabilized cells, was comparable.However, hACE2-NN-Ig binding to cells expressing SG614- and SFKO-spikes was substantially higher than that to cells expressing SD614-spikes (Fig.4a and Supplementary Fig. 9a).There are several explanations for this observation.First, SG614 increased ACE2 association by promoting an open configuration of the RBD that was suggested more favorable to ACE2 binding.Second, this mutation actually increased S1 affinity to ACE2, although the residue 614 was outside of the RBD.Third, SG614 increased total ACE2 binding by reducing S1-domain shedding.To differentiate these possibilities, we appended the Myc-tag to the N-terminus of the S-proteins that are FLAG tagged at its C-terminus and repeated the experiment, this time detecting the S1 domain using an anti-Myc antibody.As Supplementary Fig.9b shows, while total expression of SD614, SG614, and SFKO, assessed by FLAG-tag staining of permeabilized cells, is similar, the levels of SG614- and SFKO-spikes on the cell surface, measured by an anti-Myc antibody, were considerably higher than that of SD614-spikes.In fact, the ratio of Myc tag to FLAG tag is similar to the ratio of hACE2-binding to FLAG tag (Fig.4a, b), indicating that increased ACE2 binding to the SG614-spikes did not result from its increased affinity to SG614 or the open RBD configuration.Instead, these data indicate that a higher number of the S1 domain is present on the surface of SG614-expressing cells.To confirm that the monomeric interaction between hACE2 and S protein is not affected by the D614G mutation, we performed surface plasmon resonance assays."
145,"Instead, these data indicate that a higher number of the S1 domain is present on the surface of SG614-expressing cells.To confirm that the monomeric interaction between hACE2 and S protein is not affected by the D614G mutation, we performed surface plasmon resonance assays.Soluble monomeric hACE2-NN bound with a nearly identical affinity to S1G614-Fc and S1D614-Fc immobilized on a chip (Fig.4c), a result that is expected because the residue 614 is outside of the RBD.Together, these results indicate that increased ACE2 binding to the cell surface-expressed SG614 spikes is due to decreased S1 shedding.Finally, we assessed whether differential amount of functional S protein on the virion could influence neutralization sensitivity of the virus.Fig.4d shows that PVD614, PVG614, and PVFKO are similarly susceptible to neutralizing plasma derived from convalescent patients, indicating that antibody-mediated control of viruses carrying SD614 and SG614 would be similar, and that the vaccines based on the D614 genotype will still be effective against the virus carrying the D614G mutation.DiscussionOur data make clear that there are consistent differences in the efficiency with which SD614 and SG614 are incorporated into PVs and VLPs.However, the physical basis for these differences remains undefined.The different ratios of S1:S2 suggest that association between these two domains is weaker in SD614.The apparent instability of SD614 could impact the integrity of the local membrane, appropriate trafficking of the S protein, or appropriate post-translational modification of the S-protein cytoplasmic tail, which may in turn impact S-protein incorporation into the virion.Our data also make clear that both a functional proprotein convertase and a functional furin-cleavage motif are necessary to observe differences between SD614 and SG614.Although evidence is still accumulating, the increasing predominance of D614G in humans raises the possibility that viruses with this mutation have a fitness advantage, perhaps allowing more efficient person-to-person transmission.Our virological data are consistent with, but do not themselves demonstrate, this hypothesis.Interestingly, this mutation does not appear to significantly impact disease severity.It is possible that higher levels of functional S protein observed with PVG614 increase the chance of host-to-host transmission, but other factors limit the rate and efficiency of intra-host replication.Alternatively, the loss of virion-associated S proteins observed with SD614 may be compensated by greater fusion efficiency with the destabilized S protein when the next target cell is adjacent in a host tissue.It is also possible that our ability to detect the emergence of new mutations at this stage of the pandemic is simply greater than our ability to detect modest differences in pathogenesis."
146,"Alternatively, the loss of virion-associated S proteins observed with SD614 may be compensated by greater fusion efficiency with the destabilized S protein when the next target cell is adjacent in a host tissue.It is also possible that our ability to detect the emergence of new mutations at this stage of the pandemic is simply greater than our ability to detect modest differences in pathogenesis.The strong phenotypic difference we observe here between D614 and G614 suggests that more studies on the impact of the D614G mutation on the course of disease may be warranted.Finally, our data raise interesting questions about the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 as it moved presumably from horseshoe bats to humans.At some point in this process, the virus acquired a furin-cleavage site, allowing its S1/S2 boundary to be cleaved in virus-producing cells.In contrast, the S1/S2 boundary of SARS-CoV-1, and indeed all SARS-like viruses isolated from bats, civet cats, and pangolins lack this polybasic site and are instead cleaved by TMPRSS2 or endosomal cathepsins in the target cells.As we have shown in this study, there are two mechanisms with which SARS-CoV-2 could have enhanced its infectivity, namely, through D614G mutation or elimination of furin-cleavage site with an optimized replacement (Supplementary Fig. 2).However, as the virus transmits in humans, it has clearly retained the furin site while compensating for this site with D614G mutation.Therefore, the furin-cleavage site itself appears to confer a yet-to-be-determined fitness advantage.In summary, an S-protein mutation, D614G, that appears to promote SARS-CoV-2 transmission in humans also enhances functional S-protein incorporation into SARS-CoV-2 VLP and retroviral PV and increases PV infectivity.Further studies will be necessary to determine the impact of this change on the nature and severity of COVID-19.MethodsSARS-CoV-2 S protein sequences analysisTo track the D614G variation among SARS-CoV-2 isolates, S protein sequences were downloaded from GenBank by searching for “SARS-CoV-2 spike” and by filtering the result based on sequence length “1272–1273” to retrieve full-length S protein.To separate retrieved sequences by the month, the result was further filtered by release date.Genotype frequency at residue 614 was calculated using R version 3.6.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) with the Biostrings package version 2.52.Logo plots of D614G variation were generated by WebLogo version 3 after sequence alignment."

160,"INO-4800 DNA vaccine induces neutralizing antibodies and T cell activity against global SARS-CoV-2 variantsGlobal surveillance has identified emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) associated with broadened host specificity, pathogenicity, and immune evasion to vaccine-induced immunity.Here we compared humoral and cellular responses against SARS-CoV-2 VOC in subjects immunized with the DNA vaccine, INO-4800.INO-4800 vaccination induced neutralizing antibodies against all variants tested, with reduced levels detected against B.1.351.IFNγ T cell responses were fully maintained against all variants tested.Main textSARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, continues to cause unprecedented levels of mortality and socioeconomic burden.Concerningly, virus surveillance shows the global spread of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants, which are more infectious and display increased transmissibility and pathology.Some of these variants of concern (VOC) contain mutations in the Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), the region which interacts with the host ACE2 receptor, and to which many SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies target.The B.1.1.7 lineage, the first emerging VOC, contains the key N501Y and D614G mutations and the 69–70 deletion in the RBD and/or S1 regions and exhibits increased transmissibility, but does not appear to significantly evade neutralizing antibody responses generated by current vaccines approved for use.The B.1.351 and P.1 lineages have additional mutations, including E484K in the RBD region, as well as unique changes in position K417.Notably, sera isolated from convalescent individuals and vaccinees exposed to the original Wuhan Spike protein sequence have shown significantly lower levels of neutralizing activity against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants.INO-4800 is a SARS-CoV-2 Spike DNA-based vaccine that is delivered intradermally followed by electroporation (EP) using CELLECTRA® 2000 and is currently undergoing clinical development.In Phase 1 clinical trial, INO-4800 vaccination induced a balanced immune response characterized by both functional antibody and T cell responses in vaccinated subjects.Both humoral and cellular immune responses have been shown to be important components of protection against betacoronaviruses.In the present study, we have assessed the humoral and T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants elicited after INO-4800 vaccination (Supplementary Fig."

162,"The mean ID50 titers for the Wuhan, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1.were 643, 295, 105, and 664, respectively (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).Compared to Wuhan, there was a 2.1 and 6.9-fold reduction for B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, respectively, while there was no difference between Wuhan and the P.1 variant.These results are consistent with other recent studies, which have demonstrated a significant reduction in neutralizing activity in vaccinated individuals towards the B.1.351 (≥6-fold reduction), while the B.1.1.7 lineage has demonstrated a reduced activity of two-fold or less.Strikingly, while the P.1 strain presents with similar RBD mutations as B.1.351, we did not observe any reduction in neutralizing activity compared to the Wuhan strain in INO-4800 vaccinated individuals.The P.1 lineage has similar changes in the RBD to the B.1.351 lineage as they contain the N501Y mutation found in the B.1.1.7 lineage and identical E484K mutations.However, they have similar but different mutations at position K417, with a change to T for the P.1 and to N for the B.1.351 lineage.While both are changes to polar uncharged side chains, the B.1.351 N mutation carries an additional amino group.It is possible that this position and this change allow for the impact of neutralizing responses observed.In addition, since P.1 and B.1.351 have almost identical RBD mutations, changes outside the RBD may play a role in neutralization, especially in the N-terminal domain (NTD), where a large number of mutations have accumulated in the P.1 and B.1.351 variants.However, B.1.351 variant contains unique deletions in the NTD region that is a known epitope for potent neutralizing antibodies.The P.1 variant, while having similar RBD changes relative to B.1.351, it does not have said deletions in the NTD.INO-4800 cellular immune response against SARS-CoV-2 variants.PBMCs from 10 Phase 1 subjects were collected 8 weeks after receiving the second dose of INO-4800 (n = 5, 1.0 mg; n = 5, 2.0 mg).PBMCs were treated with peptide pools spanning the entire Spike proteins of the Wuhan, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, or P.1 variants, and cellular responses were measured by IFNγ ELISpot assay.Mean ± s.e.m."

164,"Recent studies have shown a dramatic reduction in serum neutralization levels against B.1.351, a 2 to 4-fold reduction against P.1, and a minimal impact against B.1.1.7.In addition, vaccine trials have shown a considerable reduction in protective efficacy against B.1.351.Interestingly, a small reduction in protective efficacy is observed in Latin American countries including Brazil, suggesting that P.1 may have emerged around the time of clinical trials were in effect.Here we report the neutralizing antibody and T cell activity measured in INO-4800 vaccinated subjects against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants first detected in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil.The neutralization levels against B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 for the INO-4800 SARS-CoV-2 Spike DNA vaccine are consistent with previous reports of subjects receiving vaccines encoding for the ancestral Spike protein.We also showed that INO-4800 generates robust neutralizing antibodies against P.1 at levels comparable to the Wuhan strain.Despite similarities in the RBD of P.1 and B.1.351, studies have reported a reduced impact in neutralization against P.1, compared to B.1.351.In sera from individuals who received the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 or the BNT162b2 vaccines, there was a 2.8 and 2.2-fold reduction in neutralization against P.1, compared to 8.6 and 6.5-fold for B.1.351, respectively.The lower resistance to neutralization conferred by the P.1 variant suggests that changes outside the RBD, especially in the NTD, where P.1 and B.1.351 acquired and accumulated different mutations, may play a role in neutralization.INO-4800 induces cross-reactive T cell responses against B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants that are comparable to the Wuhan strain.Taken together, these data demonstrate maintenance of one or both cellular and humoral arms of the immune response against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants for the INO-4800 vaccine, which will likely be critical factors to impact the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsClinical trial subject samplesSerum and PBMC samples were acquired from participants of the phase I INO-4800 clinical trial (NCT04336410) described previously.The trial has since been expanded to include participants of 51−64 and 64+ years of age as separate groups in addition to the original 18–50 age group.A 0.5 mg dose group was also added.The institutional review board of each clinical site approved the trial.All trial participants provided written informed consent."

173,"Surviving Sepsis Campaign: guidelines on the management of critically ill adults with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)BackgroundThe novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), affecting thousands of people around the world.Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed.MethodsWe formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries.All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form.The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU.We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU.We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care.We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility.Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations.ResultsThe Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which 4 are best practice statements, 9 are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations.No recommendation was provided for 6 questions.The topics were: (1) infection control, (2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, (3) hemodynamic support, (4) ventilatory support, and (5) COVID-19 therapy.ConclusionThe Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19.When available, we will provide new recommendations in further releases of these guidelines.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00134-020-06022-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.IntroductionAt the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), resulted in an acute respiratory illness epidemic in Wuhan, China."

175,"No member of the guideline panel received honoraria or remuneration for any role in the guideline development process.MethodsCOVID-19 guideline development processThe guideline development process is summarized in Fig.1.All actionable guideline questions were structured in the Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcome(s) (PICO) format, with explicit definitions, whereas descriptive questions were not.Content and methods experts in each group participated in developing the guideline questions.The PICO format provided the basis for defining inclusion and exclusion criteria for the literature searches (where performed) and for identification of relevant studies.To facilitate rapid development of recommendations, we did not perform a novel systematic prioritization of outcomes, but used the outcome prioritization informed by the ongoing SSC guideline 2020 work and expert input.Accordingly, we focused on hospital mortality and serious adverse event outcomes for most questions, and for some included other outcomes deemed critical for decision making.Literature searchFor some questions, with help of professional medical librarians, we electronically searched major databases, i.e.Cochrane Central and MEDLINE, to identify relevant systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and case series.These electronic searches were performed looking for studies published in English from inception to March 2020.To inform the recommendations on hemodynamic and ventilatory support, we used recently published systematic reviews and asked experts to identify any new relevant studies.Selection of studies and data abstractionFor selected PICO questions, a pair of reviewers screened titles and abstracts retrieved from the bibliographic databases; for each PICO question, all potentially eligible studies were assessed for eligibility according to pre-specified criteria.Content experts were asked to indicate any additional studies not identified by the search.Subsequently, pairs of reviewers independently abstracted relevant data on the corresponding PICO questions, and items relevant to risk of bias.We obtained intention-to-treat data whenever available; otherwise we used complete case data, i.e.ignoring missing data.Quality of evidenceWe used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the quality of evidence, i.e.our confidence in the estimate of the effect to support a recommendation.The quality of evidence was rated as high, moderate, low, or very low."
176,"our confidence in the estimate of the effect to support a recommendation.The quality of evidence was rated as high, moderate, low, or very low.We used the GDT online software (http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org) to generate the evidence profiles (evidence summaries).Using indirect evidenceGiven the recent emergence of COVID-19, we anticipated that there would be a scarcity of direct evidence, and therefore used a predefined algorithm to decide whether indirect evidence could inform a specific question (Figure S1-2).The SSC COVID-19 panel decided which population to extrapolate evidence from based on the context of the recommendation, and the likelihood of the presence of an effect modifier (Figure S3).Accordingly, we used, as sources of indirect evidence, data on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and other coronaviruses; in the same way, we considered, as indirect evidence, published data on supportive care in the ICU from studies on influenza and other respiratory viral infections, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis.Recommendation formulationWe used the principles outlined in the evidence to decision framework (EtD) to formulate recommendations, but because of the tight timelines we did not complete the online EtD tables.The EtD framework covers the following domains: priority setting, magnitude of benefit and harm, certainty of the evidence, patient values, balance between desirable and undesirable effects, resources and cost, equity, acceptability and feasibility.Recommendation Meaning Implications to patients Implications to clinicians Implications to policymakers Strong recommendation orBest practice statement Must do orMust avoid Almost all individuals in this situation would want the recommended intervention, and only a small proportion would not want it Most individuals should receive the recommended course of action Can be adapted as policy in most situations, including the use as performance indicators Weak recommendation Consider doing orConsider avoiding The majority of individuals in this situation would want the recommended intervention, but many would not Different choices are likely to be appropriate for different patients, and the recommendation should be tailored to the individual patient's circumstances.Such as patients', family's, or substitute decision maker's values and preferences Policies will likely be variable Implications of different recommendations to key stakeholders Recommendation Strength INFECTION CONTROL AND TESTING 1 For healthcare workers performing aerosol-generating procedures* on patients with COVID-19 in the ICU, we recommend using fitted respirator masks (N95 respirators, FFP2, or equivalent), as opposed to surgical/medical masks, in addition to other personal protective equipment (i.e."

183,"Staff should be fit tested for each different type.Surgical masks (also known as medical masks) are designed to block large particles, droplets and sprays, but are less effective in blocking small particle aerosols (< 5 mum).Recommendation 2.We recommend performing aerosol-generating procedures on ICU patients with COVID-19 in a negative pressure room .Best practice statement This recommendation is based on a consensus of recommendations from the CDC, WHO, and other public health organizations, along with epidemiologic data demonstrating that aerosol-generating procedures increased risk to healthcare workers during the SARS epidemic.Powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) can be used by healthcare workers who failed N95 mask fit testing and when N95s are in limited supply.RationaleNegative pressure rooms are an engineering control intended to prevent the spread of contagious airborne pathogens from room to room (e.g.measles, and tuberculosis).The main goal is to avoid the accidental release of pathogens into a larger space and open facility, thereby protecting healthcare workers and patients in a hospital setting.Negative air pressure is created in the patient's room to keep the pathogen inside and avoid its diffusion.By adopting this precaution when aerosol-generating procedures like tracheal intubation, bronchoscopies, or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) are performed within the room, there is a lower risk of cross-contamination among rooms and infection for staff and patients outside the room.Negative pressure is created and maintained by a ventilation system that allows extra air to enter the isolated room by differential pressure, and be exhausted directly to the outside or be filtered through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter directly before recirculation.Moreover, the presence of unnecessary staff in the room should be avoided.Negative pressure rooms have proven to be an effective measure that helped to avoid cross-contamination during the SARS epidemic.Accordingly, for aerosol-generating procedures, the WHO guidance on COVID-19 recommends the use of negative pressure rooms with a minimum of 12 air changes per hour or at least 160 L/second/patient in facilities with natural ventilation.Bronchoscopies are among the procedures at highest risk of aerosolization, and their use should be minimized.Non-invasive ventilation is also at high risk of aerosolization, and strategies have been described to contain the risk of virus spread, also according to a previous report on SARS infection.Recommendations 3.For healthcare workers providing usual care for non-ventilated COVID-19 patients, we suggest using surgical/medical masks, as opposed to respirator masks, in addition to other personal protective equipment (i.e.gloves, gown, and eye protection, such as a face shield or safety goggles).Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.4."

185,"On testing for seasonal coronavirus (OC43, HKU1, 229E, NL63) by means of PCR in this non-cluster RCT, 4.3% (9/212) of nurses in the medical mask group had RT-PCR confirmed coronavirus infection as compared with 5.7% (12/210) in the N95 respirator group.Recommendation 5.For healthcare workers performing endotracheal intubation on patients with COVID-19, we suggest using video-guided laryngoscopy, over direct laryngoscopy, if available.Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.When making these recommendations, the panel considered the lack of convincing evidence that N95 respirators improve clinical outcomes, the cost and resources associated with N95 mask use, and the need to preserve the N95 respirator supply for aerosol-generating procedures.Therefore, the panel issued a suggestion to use medical masks in this context.However, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be more easily transmissible and lethal than seasonal influenza.Specifically, an early estimate of the reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2, the average number of people an infected person subsequently infects as a function of biological properties of the pathogen in combination with social and environmental factors, is 2.3.By comparison, the estimated average R0 for the 1918 influenza pandemic that resulted in an estimated 50 million deaths globally was 1.8, and the estimated average R0 for seasonal influenza is 1.28.Therefore, a minimum of a surgical/medical mask is recommended for healthcare workers caring for non-ventilated COVID-19 patients and for healthcare workers who are performing non-aerosol-generating procedures on mechanically ventilated (closed circuit) patients with COVID-19.When scarcity is not an issue, use of a fitted respirator use of a fitted respirator mask is a reasonable option.RationaleThere is no direct evidence comparing the use of video-laryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy for intubation of patients with COVID-19.While SARS-CoV-2 appears to be predominantly spread by large respiratory droplets, intubation is likely a small particle (less than 5 mum) aerosol-generating procedure, which increases the risk of transmission to healthcare workers.Intubation is particularly risky given the close contact of healthcare workers with the patient's airway and respiratory secretions.Thus, techniques that can reduce the number of attempts at endotracheal intubation and the duration of the procedure and minimize the proximity between the operator and the patient, should be prioritized, potentially reducing the risk of complications in hypoxic COVID-19 patients.In a systematic review including 64 studies and 7044 patients, video-laryngoscopy reduced the risk of failed intubation (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.19-0.65), without a significant impact upon the proportion of successful first-pass attempts (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.48-1.3), hypoxia (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.1-1.44), or time for tracheal intubation."

187,"Accordingly, the performance of biomolecular assay may vary by site of sampling.RationaleCOVID-19 diagnosis is based on RT-PCR testing of respiratory samples from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, and of lower respiratory tract samples whenever possible.Bronchoalveolar lavage should be limited and performed only if indicated and with adequate precautions, due to the risk of aerosolization and consequent exposure of healthcare professionals.Similarly, sputum induction should be avoided due to increased risk of aerosolization.Tracheal aspirate specimens appear to carry a lower risk of aerosolization, and can sometimes be obtained without disconnecting the patient from the ventilator.The procedures involved in laboratory RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 using a number of assays currently in use are well described.Despite the generally high sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR-based assays, it may not be enough to rely on oropharyngeal swabs specimens alone for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis due to their low negative predictive value.In a recent study, only 9 out of 19 (47%) oropharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 patients tested positive by RT-PCR.Similar data were reported using RT-PCR during the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic.Using seroconversion as the ""gold standard"" for SARS diagnosis, RT-PCR assays performed on nasopharyngeal and throat specimens were positive only 65 and 70% of the time, respectively.However, no false positives were observed indicating assay specificity of 100%.Similarly, in a study accounting for CT scan findings among suspected COVID-19 cases, 48% with negative oropharyngeal or nasal swabs were considered highly likely cases, and 33% were considered probable cases.Consequently, a single negative swab from the upper airway does not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection and repeated sampling from multiple sites, including the lower airway, will increase diagnostic yield.Similarly, given that coinfection with other viral pathogens has been observed, a positive test for another respiratory virus does not rule out COVID-19, and should not delay testing if there is a high suspicion of COVID-19.Given this high specificity, a single positive swab confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19 and is enough to trigger infection control precautions and appropriate treatment of the patient.Supportive careHemodynamic supportLower respiratory tract specimens are considered to give a higher diagnostic yield than upper respiratory specimens in patients with pneumonia, consistent with what was observed for SARS, and should therefore be obtained whenever possible.Shock and cardiac injury in COVID-19 patientsStudy n ICU admission (%) Cardiac Injury (%) Shock (%) NIPPV (%) Invasive MV (%) CFR (%) Huang et al.41 32 12 7 24 5 15 Chen et al.99 23 - 4 13 4 11 Wang et al.138 26 7 9 11 12 - Guan et al.1099 - - 1 5.1 2.3 1 Yang et al."

CRT is a simple and easy test that can be used in almost any setting.Given the possible improvements in mortality, length of stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation that they may produce, as well as their availability, we suggest using dynamic parameters skin temperature, capillary refilling time, and/or lactate measurement over static parameters to assess fluid responsiveness in patients with COVID-19 and shock.RationaleNo direct evidence exists on patients with COVID-19 and shock, therefore the panel used indirect evidence from critically ill patients with sepsis and ARDS to inform this recommendation.A recent systematic review of 9 RCTs (n = 637 patients) comparing restricted versus liberal fluid volumes in the initial resuscitation of patients with sepsis found no statistically significant difference in mortality (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.69-1.10) and serious adverse events (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78-1.05).However, all assessed outcomes favored conservative fluid therapy (lower volumes).Importantly, the quantity and quality of evidence were both judged to be very low, suggesting that more research is needed.Correspondingly, in a 2017 meta-analysis of 11 RCTs (n = 2051 patients), adults and children with ARDS or sepsis managed according to a conservative fluid strategy in the post-resuscitation phase of critical illness had more ventilator-free days and shorter ICU stays than patients managed according to a liberal fluid strategy (see section on respiratory support for more details).In 2011, a large RCT of 3141 febrile African children (FEAST) found that children randomized to fluid boluses with saline or albumin had increased mortality compared with children not receiving fluid boluses.Recommendation 10.For the acute resuscitation of adults with COVID-19 and shock, we recommend using crystalloids over colloids.Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence."

198,"24.In adults with COVID-19 and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure on oxygen, we recommend that SpO2 be maintained no higher than 96%.Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence.Risk factors associated with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation are not clearly described in published reports, although from the limited available data, risk factors associated with a critical illness/ICU admission included older age (> 60 years), male gender, and the presence of underlying comorbidities such as diabetes, malignancy, and immunocompromised state.The CDC reported an overall case-fatality rate (CFR) of 2.3%, with a CFR of 14.8% in patients aged 80 years or older.In critically ill patients, the CFR was 49.0%, and it was higher than 50% in those who received invasive mechanical ventilation.The presence of pre-existing comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer were associated with higher risk of death.RationaleA recent study described the disease course of 1009 patients with COVID-19 in China and showed that 41% of all hospitalized patients and over 70% of those with severe disease required supplemental oxygen.In critically ill patients, hypoxia can be detrimental and is associated with poor outcomes.There are no randomized or non-randomized studies on the use of oxygen in adults with COVID-19.However, the panel used indirect evidence from the acutely ill population to inform the recommendations.A systematic review and meta-analysis of 25 RCTs (16,037 patients) showed that a liberal oxygen strategy is associated with increased risk of hospital mortality (RR1.21, 95% CI 1.03-1.43) in acutely ill patients.Furthermore, a meta-regression showed a linear association between risk of death and higher SpO2 targets.The median SpO2 in the liberal oxygen group was 96% (IQR 96-98) across all trials.A recent clinical practice guideline recommended that SpO2 be maintained no higher than 96%.Subsequent trials provided further guidance on oxygenation targets.The ICU-ROX trial randomized 1000 critically ill patients to receive either conservative oxygen (based on a protocol to dial down oxygen) or usual care.This trial showed no difference in 180-day mortality between the two groups (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.81-1.37).The ICU-ROX trial did not compare hyperoxia with a conservative oxygen strategy; instead it compared usual care with a conservative oxygen strategy.The recent LOCO2 trial randomized patients with ARDS to a conservative oxygen arm (target SpO2 88% to 92%) or a liberal oxygen arm (target SpO2 >= 96%)."

200,"In addition, in SARS, there are reports of increased transmission of disease to healthcare workers, especially nurses, during endotracheal intubation (OR 6.6, 95% Cl 2.3-18.9).Although this is a finding based mostly on retrospective observational studies, HFNC does not seem to confer an increased risk of transmission of disease.In studies evaluating bacterial environmental contamination, HFNC presented a contamination risk similar to that of conventional oxygen.In SARS, healthcare workers exposed to HFNC were not at increased risk of developing disease.Finally, patients may find HFNC more comfortable than, or at least as comfortable as, conventional oxygen therapy.Although some authors advised avoiding the use of HFNC in patients with COVID-19 due to the fear of disease transmission, studies supporting this advice are lacking.Although some have proposed that patients wear face masks while on HFNC therapy, we are uncertain about the efficacy and safety of this approach.This question could be addressed in future studies.RationaleRecommendation 27.In adults with COVID-19 and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, if HFNC is not available and there is no urgent indication for endotracheal intubation, we suggest a trial of NIPPV with close monitoring and short-interval assessment for worsening of respiratory failure.Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.28.We were not able to make a recommendation regarding the use of helmet NIPPV compared with mask NIPPV.It is an option, but we are not certain about its safety or efficacy in COVID-19.29.In adults with COVID-19 receiving NIPPV or HFNC, we recommend close monitoring for worsening of respiratory status, and early intubation in a controlled setting if worsening occurs.Best practice statement.In adults with COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure, we suggest the use of HFNC over NIPPV.In an RCT comparing HFNC with NIPPV in patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, HFNC resulted in reduced mortality at 90 days (HR 2.50, 95% CI 1.31-4.78), but did not significantly affect the need for intubation (50% failure rate in NIPPV vs 47% in conventional oxygen and 40% in HFNC groups; p = 0.18).Another meta-analysis comparing HFNC with NIPPV showed HFNC to decrease the need for intubation of patients, yet without significantly reducing mortality or ICU length of stay.Additionally, patients may find HFNC more comfortable than NIPPV.Given the evidence for a decreased risk of intubation with HFNC compared with NIPPV in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and studies suggesting that NIPPV may carry a greater risk of nosocomial infection of healthcare providers, we suggest HFNC over NIPPV."
201,"Additionally, patients may find HFNC more comfortable than NIPPV.Given the evidence for a decreased risk of intubation with HFNC compared with NIPPV in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and studies suggesting that NIPPV may carry a greater risk of nosocomial infection of healthcare providers, we suggest HFNC over NIPPV.However, any patients receiving HFNC or NIPPV should be monitored closely and cared for in a setting where intubation can be facilitated in the event of decompensation, as the failure rate may be high and emergency intubation in an uncontrolled setting may increase the risk of nosocomial infection of healthcare providers.RationaleIn adults presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure from COVID-19, there is no direct evidence to support the use of NIPPV; furthermore, some prior studies suggested that it may be associated with an increased risk of infection transmission to healthcare workers.Meta-analyses of RCTs showed reductions in both intubation and mortality risks with NIPPV in hypoxic respiratory failure.However, these meta-analyses included studies focused on immunocompromised, acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, or post-operative patients; their findings may therefore be less applicable to COVID-19 patients, in whom acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS are more common presentations.In acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with an etiology other than cardiogenic pulmonary edema, NIPPV has a high failure rate.In one RCT, failure was reported in 49% of patients with hypoxic respiratory failure ventilated with NIPPV; these patients therefore required intubation.In addition, patients with hypoxic respiratory failure randomized to NIPPV had higher mortality (28%, 95% CI 21-37%) than those treated with conventional oxygen therapy (23%, 95% CI 16-33%) or HFNC (13%, 95% CI 7-20%) (p = 0.02).In a cohort of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) patients, NIPPV was not associated with improved mortality or length of stay, compared with patients who were intubated without trying NIPPV.However, NIPPV was associated with a high failure rate (92.4%), leading to intubation.Patients who received NIPPV prior to intubation had increased inhaled nitric oxide requirements and increased mortality.Failure rates in other pandemics, such as influenza, H1N1 and SARS, range from 10 to 70%, while demonstrations of efficacy mainly come from case series and observational studies rather than RCTs, leading to practice variation.In China, the use of NIPPV for pandemic respiratory infection is common, whereas guidelines from Europe, Hong Kong, and the US advise against NIPPV as a first-line therapy in H1N1."
202,"Failure rates in other pandemics, such as influenza, H1N1 and SARS, range from 10 to 70%, while demonstrations of efficacy mainly come from case series and observational studies rather than RCTs, leading to practice variation.In China, the use of NIPPV for pandemic respiratory infection is common, whereas guidelines from Europe, Hong Kong, and the US advise against NIPPV as a first-line therapy in H1N1.There are additional concerns over the use of NIPPV in respiratory pandemics like COVID-19: NIPPV may aggravate severe forms of lung injury as a result of injurious transpulmonary pressures and large tidal volumes, and may delay initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation, leading to emergency or more unstable intubations that can increase the risk of transmission to the healthcare team.In addition, NIPPV is an aerosol-generating procedure that can increase the risk of transmission of disease to healthcare workers.Several other studies and meta-analyses of SARS have also highlighted the risk of nosocomial spread of the disease with NIPPV.The balance between benefit and harm when using NIPPV in adults with COVID-19 is unclear.If, in certain COVID-19 patients, other forms of respiratory failure, such as acute hypercapnic respiratory failure or acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, are known to be the cause of respiratory failure, NIPPV may be beneficial.However, because limited experience with NIPPV in pandemics suggests a high failure rate, we recommend that any patient receiving NIPPV be monitored closely and cared for in a setting where intubation can be facilitated in the event of decompensation.However, when resources become stretched, there may be insufficient ability to provide invasive ventilation, and even a moderate chance of success with NIPPV may justify its use.Summary of recommendations on the initial management of hypoxic COVID-19 patientsIf NIPPV is used, helmet NIPPV is an attractive option, if available.A single-center RCT showed decreased intubation and improved mortality from NIPPV delivered by helmet in ARDS patients.Of particular importance in the setting of a pandemic such as COVID-19, NIPPV by helmet has also been shown to reduce exhaled air dispersion, whereas face masks were insufficient.However, helmet NIPPV is more expensive, and without direct evidence of benefit in COVID-19 patients, resources should not be utilized to acquire this equipment if is not already available.Figure 2 summarizes the recommendations on HFNC and NIPPV in patients with COVID-19.Invasive Mechanical VentilationRecommendation 30.In mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and ARDS, we recommend using low tidal volume (Vt) ventilation (Vt 4-8 mL/kg of predicted body weight), over higher tidal volumes (Vt > 8 mL/kg).Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence.RationaleCurrently there are no studies addressing mechanical ventilation strategies in COVID-19 patients."
203,"In mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and ARDS, we recommend using low tidal volume (Vt) ventilation (Vt 4-8 mL/kg of predicted body weight), over higher tidal volumes (Vt > 8 mL/kg).Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence.RationaleCurrently there are no studies addressing mechanical ventilation strategies in COVID-19 patients.However, the panel of experts believes that mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 should be managed similarly to other patients with acute respiratory failure in the ICU.While mechanical ventilation is a potentially life-saving intervention, it can worsen lung injury and, through ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), contribute to multiorgan failure in patients with ARDS.One of the main ventilator strategies to minimize VILI is low Vt ventilation.A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs found an inverse association between larger Vt gradient and mortality.In addition, authors found that using a protocolized low Vt strategy with high PEEP (9 RCTs and 1629 patients) reduced the risk of death (RR, 0.80, 95% CI, 0.66-0.98).Our analysis of 5 RCTs (1181 patients) showed a reduction in hospital mortality with low Vt ventilation (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.63-0.85).On the basis of the available body of evidence, several guidelines recommended using low Vt (4-8 mL/kg of predicted body weight) in patients with ARDS.Summary of recommendations on the management of patients with COVID-19 and ARDSThe panel judged the magnitude of benefit to be moderate, the cost to be low, and the intervention to be acceptable and feasible to implement, and they therefore issued a strong recommendation to use low Vt (4-8 mL/kg predicted body weight) when ventilating patients with ARDS (Fig.3).Practical considerationsThe ARDSNet study protocol set the initial Vt at 6 mL/kg which can be increased to 8 mL/kg if the patient is double triggering or if inspiratory airway pressure decreases below PEEP.Recommendation 31.For mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and ARDS, we recommend targeting plateau pressures (Pplat) of < 30 cm H2O Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence.Strict adherence to target Vt in spontaneously breathing patients with ARDS is a challenge; patient-ventilator dyssynchrony is not uncommon.RationaleThere are no clinical trials examining the effect of plateau pressure (Pplat) limitation on COVID-19 induced ARDS.However, there is a large body of indirect evidence in patients with ARDS.Along with low Vt ventilation, Pplat limitation is a lung protective strategy to limit VILI."
204,"However, there is a large body of indirect evidence in patients with ARDS.Along with low Vt ventilation, Pplat limitation is a lung protective strategy to limit VILI.A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs found that using a lung protective strategy including protocolized low Vt and Pplat < 30 cmH2O (9 RCTs and 1629 patients) reduced the risk of death (RR, 0.80, 95% CI 0.66-0.98).A subsequent meta-analysis of RCTs comparing ventilatory strategies with low and high Pplat in patients with ARDS (15 studies) found that short-term mortality was higher in patients with Pplat > 32 cmH2O during the first week in the ICU (Day 1: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66-0.89; Day 3: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64-0.90; Day 7: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65-0.93).On the basis of the available body of evidence, several guidelines recommended keeping Pplat < 30 cm H2O in patients with ARDS.The panel judged the magnitude of benefit to be moderate, the cost to be low, the patients' values to be consistent, and the intervention to be acceptable and feasible to implement, and therefore, issued a strong recommendation to keep Pplat < 30 cmH2O when ventilating patients with ARDS.Practical considerationsRecommendation 32.For mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and moderate to severe ARDS, we suggest using a higher PEEP strategy, over a lower PEEP strategy.Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.Remarks: If using a higher PEEP strategy (i.e.PEEP > 10 cm H2O), clinicians should monitor patients for barotrauma.The ARDSNet study protocol set the initial Vt at 6 mL/kg, and then measured Pplat (after a 0.5 s inspiratory pause).If the Pplat > 30 cmH2O, Vt could be reduced in 1 mL/kg (to 4 mL/kg) steps until Pplat was within range.RationaleIn ARDS, extrinsic PEEP is used to prevent repeated opening and closing of alveoli (i.e.atelectotrauma), and therefore to reduce VILI.In addition, PEEP increases and sustains alveolar recruitment, which improves oxygenation and reduces oxygen requirement.There are no clinical trials examining the effect of PEEP on coronavirus-induced ARDS.However, there is a large body of indirect evidence in patients with ARDS."
205,"In addition, PEEP increases and sustains alveolar recruitment, which improves oxygenation and reduces oxygen requirement.There are no clinical trials examining the effect of PEEP on coronavirus-induced ARDS.However, there is a large body of indirect evidence in patients with ARDS.An individual patient data meta-analysis (IPDMA) of the 3 largest trials (2299 patients) of high PEEP found no difference in in-hospital mortality in all patients (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.86-1.04).However, in patients with ARDS, a higher PEEP strategy resulted in lower ICU mortality (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76-0.95), lower in-hospital mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81-1.0), and a reduction in the use of rescue therapies (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.53-0.75), at the expense of a possible increase in the risk of pneumothorax.A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 9 RCTs (3612 patients) examined the effect of a higher PEEP strategy on patient-important outcomes.Overall, a higher PEEP strategy did not reduce hospital mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI, 0.79-1.07).However, in a subgroup of trials that enrolled patients with oxygenation response to PEEP (6 RCTS, 1888 patients), the use of high PEEP significantly reduced in-hospital mortality, compared with a lower PEEP strategy (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69-0.98).Although the body of evidence suggests a beneficial effect of higher PEEP in selected patients, the results are likely to be confounded by the fact that low Vt ventilation was not used in the control arm of these trials.There is no clear and agreed upon definition of higher PEEP; moreover, the optimal PEEP level in ARDS patients is unknown, and is likely to vary based on the extent of disease, lung compliance, and other factors.In the aforementioned IPDMA, the median PEEP level in the high PEEP arm was 15.3 and 13.3 cm H2O on days 1 and 3, respectively, compared with median values of 9 and 8.2 cm H2O on days 1 and 3 in the low PEEP arm.Although arbitrary, clinicians could consider PEEP levels > 10 cm H2O to constitute a higher PEEP strategy, and PEEP levels < 10 cm H2O as a lower PEEP strategy.Practical considerationsRecommendation 33.For mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and ARDS, we suggest using a conservative fluid strategy over a liberal fluid strategy.Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence."
206,"Although arbitrary, clinicians could consider PEEP levels > 10 cm H2O to constitute a higher PEEP strategy, and PEEP levels < 10 cm H2O as a lower PEEP strategy.Practical considerationsRecommendation 33.For mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and ARDS, we suggest using a conservative fluid strategy over a liberal fluid strategy.Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.Because the IPDMA combined different strategies to set higher PEEP, a reasonable starting point would be to implement a strategy used in the large RCTs that were included (i.e.ALVEOLI, LOV, and ExPRESS).After increasing the PEEP level, clinicians should monitor their patients for evidence of barotrauma.Importantly, higher PEEP may result in higher Pplat, which is associated with its own risks and benefits when Pplat > 30 cmH2O.Clinicians can use the ARDS Network protocol strategies to determine the optimal PEEP level.Other available strategies include decremental PEEP strategy, the esophageal balloon technique, and electrical impedance tomography.However, the effect of using these techniques on clinical outcomes is unknown.RationaleRecommendation 34.For mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and moderate to severe ARDS, we suggest prone ventilation for 12-16 h, over no prone ventilation.Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.The optimal fluid strategy in COVID-19 is not known, however, it is plausible that these patients will respond to fluid similarly to other ARDS patients.The limited data available on COVID-19 show that cardiac failure, alone or in combination with respiratory failure, was the cause of 40% of COVID-19 deaths.Another study showed that 44% of COVID-19 patients had arrhythmia.The data suggest the presence of myocardial injury in some patients with COVID-19.Few RCTs have been published that compare conservative or deresuscitative with liberal fluid strategies in ARDS.A recent systematic review included 5 RCTs enrolling 1206 patients with ARDS.The risk of death was similar in both groups: 28% in the conservative fluid strategy group and 31.1% in the liberal strategy group (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77-1.07).This study included RCTs in critically ill patients with or without ARDS, and the authors found that a conservative fluid strategy increased ventilator-free days (MD 1.82 days; 95% CI 0.53-3.10 days) and reduced ICU length of stay (MD - 1.88 days, 95% CI - 0.12 to - 3.64 days), compared with a liberal fluid strategy.There was no difference in harm, including renal failure between the two groups.The landmark trial in ARDS patients (FACTT) found a significant reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation with a conservative fluid strategy."
207,"There was no difference in harm, including renal failure between the two groups.The landmark trial in ARDS patients (FACTT) found a significant reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation with a conservative fluid strategy.Furthermore, the majority of patients with COVID-19 in the ICU are elderly, and may develop myocardial dysfunction that could limit their ability to handle large fluid volumes.In view of the moderate benefit observed in other ARDS populations, the possible reduced cost of administering less fluids, and the feasibility of the intervention, the panel issued a weak recommendation favoring conservative fluid strategy in patients with COVID-19 and ARDSRationaleIn a series of 81 patients with COVID-19, radiographic features progressed over the first 1-2 weeks after symptom onset from predominant ground glass opacities to a mixed pattern of predominant basilar consolidation.This latter pattern may suggest a role for prone ventilation.Prone positioning theoretically makes ventilation more homogeneous by decreasing ventral alveolar distention and dorsal alveolar collapse.This may reduce the difference between the dorsal and ventral transpulmonary pressures, in addition to reducing lung compression and improving perfusion.A recent study that described the clinical course of COVID-19 in the ICU showed that prone ventilation was used in 11.5% of patients (6 out of 52).However, there are no studies available that describe the clinical course of patients with COVID-19 who were ventilated in the prone position.A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 9 RCTs (2129 patients) showed that prone ventilation for at least 12 h in patients with moderate to severe ARDS reduced mortality (5 RCTs; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56-0.99), but had no effect on mortality in studies that used prone ventilation for < 12 h (3 RCTs; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.88-1.20).On the other hand, prone ventilation increased the risks of pressure sores (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06-1.41) and endotracheal tube obstruction (RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.24-2.50).Other systematic reviews reached similar conclusions.We have moderate certainty that prone ventilation for more than 12 h in patients with moderate to severe ARDS reduces mortality, but may increase the risk of pressure sores and endotracheal tube obstruction.Healthcare workers proning patients with COVID-19 should be trained in the proper technique for proning and take infection control precautions in the event of accidental endotracheal tube disconnection from the ventilator.Proning itself is not associated with significant cost, and we believe that it may provide significant benefit."
208,"Healthcare workers proning patients with COVID-19 should be trained in the proper technique for proning and take infection control precautions in the event of accidental endotracheal tube disconnection from the ventilator.Proning itself is not associated with significant cost, and we believe that it may provide significant benefit.Further, proning can be implemented in low- and middle-income settings, and efforts should be made to provide the necessary training and education of healthcare workers to facilitate the practice (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_6jT9R7WJs).Practical considerationsA protocol for proning should be used at all institutions, based on the available resources and level of training.If prone ventilation is used, healthcare workers should be aware of complications such as pressure sores, vascular line and endotracheal tube displacement, facial edema, transient hemodynamic instability, corneal abrasions, brachial plexus injury, and hemodialysis vascular access flow issues.Recommendation 35.For mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and moderate to severe ARDS:   35.1.(NMBA), over continuous NMBA infusion, to facilitate protective lung ventilation.Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.35.2.In the event of persistent ventilator dyssynchrony, the need for ongoing deep sedation, prone ventilation, or persistently high plateau pressures, we suggest using a continuous NMBA infusion for up to 48 h.Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.In addition, clinicians should be familiar with the absolute contraindications for prone ventilation, such as unstable spine, open abdomen or open chest (i.e.surgery or trauma).Enteral nutrition via nasogastric or nasoduodenal tube can be continued during proning.RationaleSeveral professional societies have issued recommendations on the use of NMBAs in ARDS.Most issued recommendations favoring the use of an NMBA infusion in patients with moderate to severe ARDS.These recommendations were mostly based on the pooled estimates from 3 RCTs (431 patients) showing a reduction in 90-day mortality with an NMBA infusion as compared with no NMBA infusion.However, the results of the Re-evaluation of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade (ROSE) trial challenged those of previous trials.The ROSE trial investigators randomized 1006 patients with moderate or severe ARDS to receive either an infusion of NMBA for 48 h or intermittent NMBA boluses on an as needed basis.The ROSE trial showed that a continuous infusion of cisatracurium did not improve any patient important outcomes.Recommendations 36.In mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 ARDS, we recommend against the routine use of inhaled nitric oxide.Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.37."
209,"In mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 ARDS, we recommend against the routine use of inhaled nitric oxide.Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.37.In mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19, severe ARDS and hypoxemia despite optimizing ventilation and other rescue strategies, we suggest a trial of inhaled pulmonary vasodilator as a rescuetherapy; if no rapid improvement in oxygenation is observed, the treatment should be tapered off.Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.Due to differences in design between the ROSE trial and the earlier trials, we did not perform a meta-analysis for mortality outcome, although the pooled estimate for barotrauma favored continuous NMBA infusion (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.35-0.85).The panel suggests that a continuous NMBA infusion should be reserved for patients who have an indication for ongoing paralysis in which intermittent dosing may not suffice, such as patients with persistent ventilator dyssynchrony, and patients needing ongoing deep sedation prone ventilation, or persistently high plateau pressures.The effect of NMBAs on long-term outcomes is unclear.RationaleThere are no studies that describe the use of pulmonary vasodilators in COVID-19 patients.A Cochrane review identified 13 RCTs (1243 patients) on inhaled nitric oxide in ARDS; this treatment showed no significant effect on mortality (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.9-1.19), and was associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.17-2.16).Inhaled nitric oxide results in a transient improvement in oxygenation.The subgroup of studies reporting PaO2/FiO2 (mm Hg) values up to 24 h after the intervention showed a statistically significant difference in favor of inhaled nitric oxide, which was not present beyond 24 h. No study assessed the use of inhaled nitric oxide as a ""rescue"" therapy.Because of the possible harm from inhaled nitric oxide and the absence of a clear mortality benefit, the panel issued a strong recommendation against its routine use in patients with ARDS.However, in view of the finding of improved oxygenation, a trial of inhaled nitric oxide as a ""rescue"" therapy, after trying other options, is reasonable if available.If inhaled nitric oxide is used without a good response in terms of oxygenation, it should be tapered off to avoid rebound the pulmonary vasoconstriction that can occur with prolonged use and abrupt discontinuation.Recommendations 38.For mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and hypoxemia despite optimizing ventilation, we suggest using recruitment maneuvers, over not using recruitment maneuvers.Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.39."
210,"For mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and hypoxemia despite optimizing ventilation, we suggest using recruitment maneuvers, over not using recruitment maneuvers.Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.39.If recruitment maneuvers are used, we recommend against using staircase (incremental PEEP) recruitment maneuvers.Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.No adequately powered RCTs have evaluated inhaled prostacyclins such as ilioprost, therefore, we could not recommend against or for their use in severe ARDS.RationaleNo studies have assessed the role of recruitment maneuvers (RMs) in patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19.RMs aim to improve oxygenation by increasing transpulmonary pressure to open atelectatic alveoli.However, exposure to high levels of positive pressure may lead to barotrauma, as well as cause transient hypotension in already critically ill and unstable patients.We assessed 8 indirect RCTs assessing RMs in ARDS patients, including patients with sepsis due to bacterial or viral pneumonia.Varying strategies were used to help recruit atelectatic lungs, however two strategies, in particular, were common in the 8 RCTs included in this meta-analysis.Traditional RMs are described as prolonged inspiratory holds for a set duration of time on higher levels of CPAP, most commonly 35-40 cm H2O for 40 s. Incremental PEEP titration RMs are described as incremental increases in PEEP from 25 to 35 to 45 cm H20 for 1-2 min each.In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 6 RCTs (1423 patients), RMs reduced mortality and the use of rescue interventions, and improved oxygenation at 24 h without increasing the risk of barotrauma.Similarly, we identified 8 RCTs (2544 patients) that reported on in-hospital mortality.In these studies, RMs were not associated with reduced mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78-1.04).However, subgroup analyses suggested that traditional RMs significantly reduced mortality (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75-0.97), whereas incremental PEEP titration RMs increased mortality (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.97-1.17).While the effects of RMs on oxygenation may be transient, the studies showed a significant improvement in oxygenation after 24 h. Trials used different PEEP strategies in intervention and control arms; RMs are best combined with a higher PEEP strategy.Recommendation 40."

Trials used different PEEP strategies in intervention and control arms; RMs are best combined with a higher PEEP strategy.Recommendation 40.In mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19 and refractory hypoxemia despite optimizing ventilation, use of rescue therapies, and proning, we suggest using venovenous (VV) ECMO if available, or referring the patient to an ECMO center.Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.Remark: Due to the resource-intensive nature of ECMO, and the need for experienced centers and healthcare workers, and infrastructure, ECMO should only be considered in carefully selected patients with COVID-19 and severe ARDS.Patients with severe ARDS and hypoxemia may benefit from traditional recruitment maneuvers along with higher levels of PEEP, but evidence specific to COVID-19 is needed.Patients receiving RMs should be monitored closely for severe desaturation, hypotension or barotrauma.RMS should be stopped if they lead to patient deterioration.RationaleThere are no clinical trials of ECMO in COVID-19 patients.A recent report from China suggested that 11.5% of COVID-19 cases in the ICU received ECMO, but the clinical courses and the outcomes of these patients have not been reported yet.The Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia established an ECMO program during the MERS-CoV epidemic.In a retrospective cohort study of 35 patients with MERS-CoV and refractory hypoxemia, the group of patients who received VV ECMO had lower in-hospital mortality (65 vs. 100%, p = 0.02).However, this cohort study is at high risk of selection bias given its retrospective design.Only two RCTs have evaluated ECMO vs. conventional mechanical ventilation in severe ARDS.Guidelines published in 2017 were unable to provide specific guidance on the use of ECMO, and further research was recommended.Although the most recent RCT (EOLIA) was stopped early for futility, a re-analysis of this trial using a Bayesian approach provided a more favorable interpretation, suggesting lower mortality with ECMO in severe ARDS.A recent systematic review including two RCTs (429 patients) found a reduction in 60-day mortality with ECMO (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58-0.92), but the risk of major bleeding was higher with ECMO.COVID-19 therapyECMO is a resource-intensive technique restricted to specialized centers, and it remains an extremely limited resource.Therefore, its use as a rescue therapy should be reserved for carefully selected patients."

213,"Although interesting, we judged these preliminary reports to be an insufficient basis for formulating recommendations, due to the risk of confounding.Therefore, we used indirect evidence from community acquired pneumonia, ARDS, and other viral infections to inform our recommendation.There are several RCTs on the use of systemic corticosteroids in hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia, mostly non-ICU patients, some with sepsis or septic shock.A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs showed that using corticosteroids may reduce the need for mechanical ventilation (5 RCTs; 1060 patients; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26-0.79), ARDS (4 RCTs; 945 patients; RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10-0.56) and the duration of hospitalization (6 RCTs; 1499 patients; MD - 1.00 day, 95% CI, - 1.79 to - 0.21), but increase the risk of hyperglycemia requiring treatment.However, these trials included different populations, the effect on mortality outcome was unclear, and they used different drugs and dosing regimens.In addition, there are some concerns about corticosteroid use in viral pneumonias.Therefore, the results may not be generalizable to the COVID-19 population.There are many published observational studies on the use of steroids in viral pneumonias (i.e.influenza virus, coronaviruses, and others), but they are prone to confounding, as sicker patients usually receive corticosteroids.We updated a recent Cochrane review on the use of corticosteroids in influenza and searched for studies on other coronaviruses.We included a total of 15 cohort studies on influenza and 10 on coronaviruses.Our meta-analysis of adjusted ORs showed an association between corticosteroid use and increased mortality (OR 2.76, 95% CI 2.06-3.69), but the effect in the patients with other coronaviruses was unclear (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.32-2.17).Also, these studies are limited by significant heterogeneity.We found significant homogeneity between observational studies on the use of corticosteroids in ARDS caused by coronaviruses and in general viral ARDS (I2 = 82% and 77% respectively).Furthermore, in both cases, the summary statistic tended toward harm with the use of steroids.We updated a recent Cochrane review and identified an additional RCT dealing with ARDS.Overall, we included 7 RCTs enrolling 851 patients with ARDS.The use of corticosteroids reduced mortality (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59-0.95) and duration of mechanical ventilation (MD - 4.93 days, 95% CI - 7.81 to - 2.06).However, these trials were not focused on viral ARDS, which limits the generalizability of their results to COVID-19 patients.In addition, we reviewed observational studies on corticosteroid use in viral ARDS, and identified 4 cohort studies."
214,"However, these trials were not focused on viral ARDS, which limits the generalizability of their results to COVID-19 patients.In addition, we reviewed observational studies on corticosteroid use in viral ARDS, and identified 4 cohort studies.Although the point estimate showed increased mortality, the CI included substantial harm and benefit (OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.76-2.57).In a recent RCT (INTEREST trial), the use of recombinant interferon beta1b (rIFN beta1ba) did not reduce mortality in ARDS patients, but in the subgroup of patients receiving corticosteroids, rIFN beta1ba use was associated with increased mortality (OR, 2.53, 95% CI 1.12-5.72).The only direct evidence comes from a retrospective cohort study of 201 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.This study showed an association between corticosteroid use and lower mortality in patients with COVID-19 and ARDS (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20-0.72).However, the estimate was not adjusted for confounding factors.The effect of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients with sepsis or septic shock may be different.Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs in sepsis showed small improvements in mortality and faster resolution of shock with corticosteroid use, compared with not using corticosteroids (see the previous section on hemodynamic support).It is widely recognized that corticosteroids have a range of adverse effects.In viral pneumonia in the ICU, several studies showed increase in viral shedding with corticosteroid use, potentially indicating viral replication, but the clinical implication of increased viral shedding is uncertain.Recommendation 43.In mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 and respiratory failure, we suggest using empiric antimicrobials/antibacterial agents, over no antimicrobials.Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.Remark: if the treating team initiates empiric antimicrobials, they should assess for de-escalation daily, and re-evaluate the duration of therapy and spectrum of coverage based on the microbiology results and the patient's clinical status.Considering the above, the panel issued a suggestion against the routine use of systemic corticosteroids for respiratory failure in COVID-19, and a suggestion to use corticosteroids in the sicker population of COVID-19 with ARDS.If clinicians use corticosteroids in ARDS, they should use lower dosing and shorter treatment courses.RationaleThere are no controlled clinical trials evaluating the use of empiric antimicrobials in COVID-19 patients or other coronaviruses.This recommendation is therefore based upon extrapolation of data from other viral pneumonias, particularly influenza.Identifying bacterial co-infection or superinfection in patients with COVID-19 is challenging, as the symptoms may be similar to those of the underlying viral infection."
215,"This recommendation is therefore based upon extrapolation of data from other viral pneumonias, particularly influenza.Identifying bacterial co-infection or superinfection in patients with COVID-19 is challenging, as the symptoms may be similar to those of the underlying viral infection.The diagnostic difficulty is reflected in high rates of intravenous antibiotics administered in Wuhan: 53% with non-severe disease and > 90% of patients admitted to hospital or the ICU.Data on the prevalence of bacterial superinfection in patients with COVID-19 are limited, as in larger case studies clinicians were often too overwhelmed to systematically obtain high-quality samples.In critically ill patients with MERS, 18% had bacterial and 5% viral co-infections.Co-infection with Staphylococcus aureus is common with influenza pneumonia and can be especially virulent.Recent clinical practice guidelines recommend initiating empiric antibacterial therapy in adults with community-acquired pneumonia who test positive for influenza.Data from critically ill patients demonstrate secondary infection in about 11% of cases, although the numbers are small.Isolated organisms included gram-negative organisms such as K. pneumoniae, P. aeruganosa, and S. marcescens.On the basis of these limited data it is difficult to determine patterns of superinfection, including the risk of S. aureus infection, commonly seen in influenza.Recommendation 44.For critically ill adults with COVID-19 who develop fever, we suggest using acetaminophen/paracetamol for temperature control, over no treatment.Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.In patients with COVID-19 and hypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, the panel suggest empiric antimicrobial treatment, on the basis that superinfection is reasonably common in this population and may to lead to a substantial increase in mortality, as in pandemic influenza.Therefore, critically ill patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be treated with empiric antimicrobial therapy in accordance with the clinical syndrome (e.g.community-acquired or hospital-acquired pneumonia).Secondary infections occur in patients with COVID-19, but the incidence is unknown given the very limited data.These infections should be treated according to clinical and microbiological data.RationaleThe majority of patients with COVID-19 develop fever during hospitalization (92% of those with severe disease).In the largest report from China, the median temperature across 1099 patients was 38.3  C (IQR 37.8-38.9).Data from critically ill patients in general are available."
216,"In the largest report from China, the median temperature across 1099 patients was 38.3  C (IQR 37.8-38.9).Data from critically ill patients in general are available.We reviewed the literature and identified 12 RCTs (1785 patients) that examined the effect of fever control in the critically ill population, excluding neurological indication for temperature control; active temperature management (pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic) did not reduce the risk of death (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.81-1.31), ICU length of stay (MD - 0.07 days, 95% CI - 0.70-0.56), but it was effective in reducing body temperature (MD - 0.36  C, 95% CI - 0.42 lower to - 0.29).Given the safety of acetaminophen and lack of harm in the body of evidence, increasing patient comfort through fever management maybe important.Therefore, we issued a suggestion for clinicians to consider using pharmacologic agents for controlling fever in COIVD-19 patients.Recommendation 45.In critically ill adults with COVID-19, we suggest against the routine use of standard intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG).Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to treat fever in patients with COVID-19 continues to be debated.Until more evidence is available, we suggest using acetaminophen/paracetamol to treat fever.RationaleRecommendation 46.In critically ill adults with COVID-19, we suggest against the routine use of convalescent plasma.Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.The use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been reported in several series of COVID-19 patients, but no efficacy data are available.In the absence of adequate titers of neutralizing antibodies, standard intravenous immunoglobulin is unlikely to have a biologic effect in COVID-19.While IVIG may have immunomodulatory actions, its use can, rarely, also be associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events including anaphylactic reactions, aseptic meningitis, renal failure, thromboembolism, hemolytic reactions, transfusion-related lung injury, and other late reactions.Preparations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies are being developed.However, data from recent trials on the use of antibody-based therapies (immune plasma, hyperimmune globulin, monoclonal antibody to hemagglutinin stalk) in hospitalized seasonal influenza patients did not demonstrate improvement in outcomes.RationaleRecommendation 47.In critically ill adults with COVID-19:   47.1.We suggest against the routine use of lopinavir/ritonavir (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).47.2."
217,"We suggest against the routine use of lopinavir/ritonavir (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).47.2.There is insufficient evidence to issue a recommendation on the use of other antiviral agents in critically ill adults with COVID-19.Convalescent plasma obtained from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 has been suggested as a potential therapy that may provide passive immunity from SARS-CoV2-specific antibodies.Convalescent plasma has been used to treat several other viral infections, including those caused by SARS coronavirus, avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, and influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus.A recent meta-analysis of observational studies using passive immunotherapy for the treatment of severe acute respiratory infections of viral etiology suggests that convalescent plasma therapy was associated with reduction in mortality (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.14-0.45).During the current outbreak in China, convalescent plasma was used in some patients with COVID-19.However, data on the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma are limited, and the target for sufficient levels of neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 is unknown.A study on MERS concluded that use of convalescent plasma might be feasible but was challenging due to a small pool of potential donors with sufficiently high antibody titers.An RCT in patients with confirmed Ebola virus disease showed that convalescent plasma, with unknown levels of neutralizing antibodies, was not associated with improvement in survival.Another RCT in patients with seasonal influenza treated with high-titer versus low-titer anti-influenza immune plasma was terminated for futility because of the lack of effect on the primary outcome measured by a 6-point ordinal scale of clinical status on Day 7.Given the lack of convincing evidence from RCTs and the uncertainty surrounding the optimal preparation of convalescent plasma and its safety, we suggest that it should not be routinely used in treating patients with COVID-19 until more evidence is available.RationaleThe prolonged detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the respiratory tract and sometimes other sites of seriously ill COVID-19 patients provides the rationale for administration of antiviral agents to reduce replication in efforts to improve clinical outcomes.At present, no direct-acting antivirals have been proven to inhibit replication or provide clinical benefit in COVID-19 or MERS patients.A considerable number of agents approved for other indications have been proposed for use, but the comments below address the most promising ones.Several others are undergoing testing (e.g."
218,"At present, no direct-acting antivirals have been proven to inhibit replication or provide clinical benefit in COVID-19 or MERS patients.A considerable number of agents approved for other indications have been proposed for use, but the comments below address the most promising ones.Several others are undergoing testing (e.g.arbidol [umifenovir], favipiravir, ribavirin, traditional Chinese medicines, inhaled interferons), alone or in combinations, and in one or more countries.Lopinavir is an antiretroviral protease inhibitor used in combination with ritonavir to ensure adequate lopinavir exposure for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.Because it was found to show in vitro activity against SARS-CoV, lopinavir/ritonavir was administered, in combination with high-dose oral ribavirin and a tapering course of systemic corticosteroids, in a cohort of 41 patients with SARS, and was found to be associated with significantly fewer adverse clinical outcomes (ARDS or death) compared with ribavirin alone used in 111 historical controls that received ribavirin and corticosteroids.In a high-throughput screening for antiviral compounds, lopinavir inhibited replication of MERS-CoV in vitro.In an animal model of MERS-CoV infection, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir or IFN-beta1b was associated with virologic, histologic and clinical improvement versus placebo.Lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta 1-b is being tested in an RCT in MERS-CoV patients.This combination was considered the second candidate in a WHO research prioritization list of therapeutic agents.The drug has a generally good safety profile, but may have interactions with many drugs commonly used in critically ill patients (http://www.covid19-druginteractions.org/).A recent RCT compared the use of lopinavir/ritonavir to usual care in 199 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China.In this trial, lopinavir/ritonavir did not significantly reduce 28-day mortality (RD - 5.8%; 95% CI - 17.3 to 5.7) or time to clinical improvement (MD 1.31 days, 95% CI 0.95-1.80).In addition, lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with more adverse events.This trial is the only available direct evidence on the use of lopinavir/ritonavir in patients with COVID-19, however, it has several limitations.The trial was unblinded and it enrolled a small number of patients (n = 199) with a small number of events (44 deaths in total), which limits our confidence in its results."
219,"This trial is the only available direct evidence on the use of lopinavir/ritonavir in patients with COVID-19, however, it has several limitations.The trial was unblinded and it enrolled a small number of patients (n = 199) with a small number of events (44 deaths in total), which limits our confidence in its results.Nevertheless, the routine use of lopinavir/ritonavir in critically ill patients is probably not warranted, and a weak recommendation against the routine use of lopinavir/ritonavir in critically ill COVID-19 patients is reasonable.Lopinavir/ritonavir is one of the arms in a planned WHO core treatment protocol for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and in the REMAP-CAP (Randomized, Embedded, Multifactorial Adaptive Platform Trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia) trial (NCT02735707) The results of ongoing trials will help increase the precision of estimates and the certainty in the evidence.Recommendation 48.There is insufficient evidence to issue a recommendation on the use of recombinant rIFNs, alone or in combination with antivirals, in critically ill adults with COVID-19.Remdesivir is the prodrug of an adenosine analog, which incorporates into nascent viral RNA chains and results in premature termination.It was considered the most promising drug in an informal consultation on research prioritization of candidate therapeutic agents by WHO.Currently, there are published case reports but no published trials on the use of remdesivir in COVID-19.Remdesivir demonstrated effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV in in vitro studies.Furthermore, studies in animal models of MERS-CoV showed that it was more effective than control and superior to lopinavir/ritonavir combined with systemic IFN-beta.Although intravenous remdesivir appears to adequately tolerated, a recent RCT showed that it was less effective than several antibody therapies in Ebola virus disease.There are several ongoing RCTs that aim to examine the efficacy and safety of intravenous remdesivir for severe COVID-19 (clinicaltrials.gov NCT04257656) and for mild and moderate COVID-19 (clinicaltrials.gov NCT04252664).Another trial sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is recruiting patients in USA (clinicaltrials.gov NCT04280705).We will update our guidelines as new evidence emerges.RationaleRecombinant interferon, often combined with ribavirin therapy, has been used in patients with MERS and SARS.Different preparations of recombinant rIFNs (rIFN-alpha2a, rIFN-alpha2b, rIFN-beta1a and rIFN-beta1b) have shown activity against MERS-CoV in Vero and LLC-MK2 cells, and in a rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection."
220,"We will update our guidelines as new evidence emerges.RationaleRecombinant interferon, often combined with ribavirin therapy, has been used in patients with MERS and SARS.Different preparations of recombinant rIFNs (rIFN-alpha2a, rIFN-alpha2b, rIFN-beta1a and rIFN-beta1b) have shown activity against MERS-CoV in Vero and LLC-MK2 cells, and in a rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection.The largest cohort of critically ill patients with MERS showed that rIFN-alpha2a, rIFN-alpha2b, rIFN-beta1a and ribavirin were not associated with lower mortality (OR 1.03, 95% CI .73-1.44) or reduced viral clearance when adjusted for time-varying covariables.The relative effectiveness of different interferons against SARS-CoV-2 is unknown at this point.Recommendation 49.There is insufficient evidence to issue a recommendation on the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in critically ill adults with COVID-19.In vitro data showed that rIFN-beta displayed the strongest MERS-CoV inhibition among different rIFN preparations (rIFN-alpha2b, rIFN-gamma, rIFN-universal, and rIFN-alpha2a, rIFN-beta), at 41 times lower than the previously reported 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of rIFN-alpha2b.An RCT to examine the effect of a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and rIFN-beta-1b on mortality of hospitalized patients with MERS is currently recruiting patients.Unpublished data indicate that IFN-beta inhibits SARS-C0V-2 in cell culture, and IFNs have been prioritized for study in COVID-19 by the WHO.RationaleRecommendation 50.There is insufficient evidence to issue a recommendation on the use of tocilizumab in critically ill adults with COVID-19.Chloroquine and its metabolite, hydroxychloroquine, are antimalarial agents that have demonstrated antiviral effects on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.Prior studies found inhibitory effects of chloroquine for multiple RNA viruses in vitro, but RCTs in treatment of dengue and chikungunya virus infections and of influenza prophylaxis failed to demonstrate antiviral or clinical benefits.In one non-human primate model of chikungunya infection, it was shown that chloroquine's immunomodulatory effects were associated with delayed immune responses, higher levels of viral replication, and worse illness.A news briefing suggested that its use in more than 100 patients showed ""that it was superior to the control in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promoting a virus negative conversion, and shortening the disease course"", but the data have not been published yet.A recent consensus document recommended chloroquine phosphate 500 mg twice daily for minimum of 5 days, with dose modifications if severe gastrointestinal side effects occur.Since chloroquine is not available in some countries, hydroxychloroquine is an alternative."
221,"A recent consensus document recommended chloroquine phosphate 500 mg twice daily for minimum of 5 days, with dose modifications if severe gastrointestinal side effects occur.Since chloroquine is not available in some countries, hydroxychloroquine is an alternative.A recent study in China explored various dosing regimens of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models.The study found hydroxychloroquine to be more potent than chloroquine in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.Based on these models, a hydroxychloroquine loading dose of 400 mg twice daily followed by 200 mg twice daily for 4 days was recommended.A recent systematic review found no published studies in COVID-19 patients.Pending the results of ongoing trials, we were unable to issue a recommendation for or against chloroquine.RationaleTocilizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin that functions in the immune response and blocks IL-6 receptor binding to IL-6.It has been approved for CRS and other inflammatory conditions related to IL-6 related inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis.Severely ill patients with COVID-19 may have an extreme immune response leading to severe respiratory failure.In such cases, inhibition of IL-6 may help attenuate the cytokine release syndrome by reducing cytokine concentrations and acute phase reactant production.Ongoing trials of tocilizumab will help address the safety and efficacy of this therapy in COVID-19.From the rheumatoid arthritis literature, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 6 RCTs (3 with 8/mg dose and 3 with 4 mg/kg dose) showed an increased risk of adverse events compared with control treatment (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.26-1.86), and an increased risk of infections (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.07-1.58).Another systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs on tocilizumab in rheumatoid arthritis found an increased risk of infectious respiratory adverse events (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.04-2.25).Since we have no data on the safety or efficacy of tocilizumab in COVID-19, we were unable to issue a recommendation.Other agentsNafamostat is a synthetic serine protease inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of MERS CoV.Nitazoxanide is an antiprotozoal agent with antiviral potential against several respiratory viruses including influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus.An in vitro study showed that both nafamostat and nitazoxanide inhibited SARS-CoV-2.An RCT in patients with acute uncomplicated influenza demonstrated that the use of nitazoxanide reduced the duration of symptoms."
222,"An in vitro study showed that both nafamostat and nitazoxanide inhibited SARS-CoV-2.An RCT in patients with acute uncomplicated influenza demonstrated that the use of nitazoxanide reduced the duration of symptoms.However, in hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infection in Mexico, nitazoxanide was not found to be superior to placebo.Electronic supplementary materialBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.This article is co-published in the journals Intensive Care Medicine (DOI:10.1007/s00134-020-06022-5) and Critical Care medicine (DOI:10.1097/CCM.0000000000004363).Publisher's NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.FundingThere was no dedicated funding for this guideline.Compliance with ethical standardsConflicts of interestDr.Yaseen Arabi is the principal investigator on a clinical trial for lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon in Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and he was a nonpaid consultant on antiviral active for MERS-coronavirus (CoV) for Gilead Sciences and SAB Biotherapeutics.He is an investigator on REMAP-CAP trial and is a Board Members of the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC).Dr. Eddy Fan declared receiving consultancy fees from ALung Technologies and MC3 Cardiopulmonary.Dr. Maurizio Cecconi declared consultancy work with Edwards Lifesciences, Directed Systems, and Cheetah Medical.Dr. Lennie Derde is the NVIC (Dutch National ICU society) chair of Taskforce Infectious Diseases (standing committee), member of ESICM Coronavirus Taskforce (started with this outbreak), chair ESICM Clinical Training Committee, all are unpaid positions.Dr. Frederick Hyden is non-compensated consultant to Gilead Sciences (antivirals for RVIS including remdesivir), Regeneraon (monoclonals for RVIs including MERS), and SAB Biotherapeutics (polyclonal antibodies for RVIs including MERS).Other authors declared no conflict of interest.ReferencesClinical characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in ChinaEuropean Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Situation update worldwide, 4 March 2020.2020, March 4. https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-casesConflicts of interest disclosure forms and management in critical care clinical practice guidelinesUnderstanding conflicts of interestGRADE guidelines: 2."

235,"Effectiveness of the BNT162b2 Covid-19 Vaccine against the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 VariantsTo The Editor: The messenger RNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) has 95% efficacy against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).Qatar launched a mass immunization campaign with this vaccine on December 21, 2020.As of March 31, 2021, a total of 385,853 persons had received at least one vaccine dose and 265,410 had completed the two doses.Vaccination scale-up occurred as Qatar was undergoing its second and third waves of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which were triggered by expansion of the B.1.1.7 variant (starting in mid-January 2021) and the B.1.351 variant (starting in mid-February 2021).The B.1.1.7 wave peaked during the first week of March, and the rapid expansion of B.1.351 started in mid-March and continues to the present day.Viral genome sequencing conducted from February 23 through March 18 indicated that 50.0% of cases of Covid-19 in Qatar were caused by B.1.351 and 44.5% were caused by B.1.1.7.Nearly all cases in which virus was sequenced after March 7 were caused by either B.1.351 or B.1.1.7.Data on vaccinations, polymerase-chain-reaction testing, and clinical characteristics were extracted from the national, federated Covid-19 databases that have captured all SARS-CoV-2–related data since the start of the epidemic (Section S1 of the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org).Vaccine effectiveness was estimated with a test-negative case–control study design, a preferred design for assessing vaccine effectiveness against influenza (see the Supplementary Appendix).A key strength of this design is the ability to control for bias that may result from differences in health care–seeking behavior between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons.The estimated effectiveness of the vaccine against any documented infection with the B.1.1.7 variant was 89.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 85.9 to 92.3) at 14 or more days after the second dose (Table 1 and Table S2)."

239,"Human Prion Disorders: Review of the Current Literature and a Twenty-Year Experience of the National Surveillance Center in the Czech RepublicHuman prion disorders (transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, TSEs) are unique, progressive, and fatal neurodegenerative diseases caused by aggregation of misfolded prion protein in neuronal tissue.Due to the potential transmission, human TSEs are under active surveillance in a majority of countries; in the Czech Republic data are centralized at the National surveillance center (NRL) which has a clinical and a neuropathological subdivision.The aim of our article is to review current knowledge about human TSEs and summarize the experience of active surveillance of human prion diseases in the Czech Republic during the last 20 years.Possible or probable TSEs undergo a mandatory autopsy using a standardized protocol.From 2001 to 2020, 305 cases of sporadic and genetic TSEs including 8 rare cases of Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS) were confirmed.Additionally, in the Czech Republic, brain samples from all corneal donors have been tested by the NRL immunology laboratory to increase the safety of corneal transplants since January 2007.All tested 6590 corneal donor brain tissue samples were negative for prion protein deposits.Moreover, the routine use of diagnostic criteria including biomarkers are robust enough, and not even the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted TSEs surveillance in the Czech Republic.1.Background:Human Prion Diseases in ReviewPrion diseases are transmissible, progressive, and fatal neurodegenerative disorders associated with the aggregation of a misfolded prion protein (PrP).Human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), kuru, and fatal familial insomnia (FFI).The cellular prion protein (PrPC) functions as a glycolipid-anchored cell membrane sialoglycoprotein localized in presynaptic membranes that has neuroprotective and pro-myelinating roles.Additionally, it participates in neurotransmission, zinc and copper transport, and calcium homeostasis.Moreover, under laboratory conditions, PrPC promotes greater neuronal resistance after an ischemic cerebral insult.All human prion diseases are associated with a pathological self-replicating conformation of PrP, the most fundamental of which is the change of the PrP tertiary structure, by post-translational processes, into the predominant beta-sheet pattern.The process results in the formation of a markedly hydrophobic form of PrP with a clear tendency toward aggregation, subsequent oligomerization, and formation of amyloid fibrils."
240,"Moreover, under laboratory conditions, PrPC promotes greater neuronal resistance after an ischemic cerebral insult.All human prion diseases are associated with a pathological self-replicating conformation of PrP, the most fundamental of which is the change of the PrP tertiary structure, by post-translational processes, into the predominant beta-sheet pattern.The process results in the formation of a markedly hydrophobic form of PrP with a clear tendency toward aggregation, subsequent oligomerization, and formation of amyloid fibrils.The pathological PrPSc (scrapie isoform of the prion protein) aggregates that arise from this process are extremely resistant to physical and chemical changes, and unlike most proteins, these molecules are not denatured by boiling.Human prion diseases are defined as transmissible and rapidly progressive degenerative diseases of the central nervous system caused by an accumulation of pathologically conformed PrP.Historically, the first mention of CJD comes from 1920 and 1921, when neurologist Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt and neuropathologist Alfons Maria Jakob described a ""nosologically very closely connected if not identical affection"" of several patients.Kuru was given attention in the first half of the 20th century as it was described in Papua New Guinea among cannibalistic tribes; the disease is currently considered extinct.The most recent form of TSE, i.e., Variant CJD (vCJD), was first identified in 1996 in the United Kingdom, which to this day remains the country with the highest number of cases (174) out of a total of 232 worldwide.The last three known cases of vCJD came from Italy and France.An Italian patient with occupational contact with vCJD but without evidence of a laboratory incident died in 2016, and a French laboratory worker died in 2018, 7.5 years after a cutting incident with BSE transgenic mice contaminated instrument.The last case that is under investigation appeared in 2021, when CJD was diagnosed in a retired French laboratory worker which led to 3-month moratorium on the study of prions in France.1.1.Sporadic Human Prion DiseasesCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is the most common human prion disease.The neuropathological characterization of CJD is spongiform encephalopathy in cerebral and/or cerebellar cortex and/or subcortical grey matter.It can also be described as encephalopathy with PrP immunoreactivity (plaque and/or diffuse synaptic and/or patchy/perivacuolar type).Three types, the most common being sporadic (sCJD), followed by genetic (gCJD) and acquired that can be further subdivided into iatrogenic (iCJD), and Variant (vCJD), are distinguished according to their different aetiologies.Using Western blot, we can distinguish between PrPSc type 1 and 2.1.1.1.Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob DiseaseThe sporadic CJD begins with an accidental conversion of physiological PrPC to pathologically conformed PrPSc, which occurs in about 85% of CJD cases."
241,"Using Western blot, we can distinguish between PrPSc type 1 and 2.1.1.1.Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob DiseaseThe sporadic CJD begins with an accidental conversion of physiological PrPC to pathologically conformed PrPSc, which occurs in about 85% of CJD cases.The worldwide incidence of sCJD is reported to be one to two cases per million.Unlike vCJD, clinical signs and neuropathological findings differ from case to case, which is probably caused by different molecular phenotypes.According to the diagnostic criteria recently published by Watson et al.(see Table 1), three conditions can be distinguished: possible CJD (clinical presentation only and exclusion of distinct aetiologies, i.e., tumor, cerebrovascular lesions, autoimmune disorders, neuroinfection, neurodegenerative dementia, etc.), probable CJD (clinical presentation plus biomarkers: protein 14-3-3, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG) with indicated sensitivity 67% and specificity 86%, and RT-QuIC) and definite CJD (neuropathologically confirmed).The disease usually lasts for a few months, generally less than one year.The duration of the disease must be less than two years; longer durations are an exclusionary clinical criterion for possible sCJD.Due to the risk of iatrogenic transmission, brain biopsy is only applicable in specific cases where a definitive diagnosis is critical.Arguments against brain biopsies in suspected CJD cases include the high probability of a unconclusive result; additionally, it does not affect patient treatment even when the biopsy confirms clinical suspicions.1.1.2.Sporadic Fatal InsomniaSporadic fatal insomnia (sFI) is defined as a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease with a clinical phenotype very similar to the fatal familial insomnia characterized by neurological and cognitive deterioration along with severe sleep impairment, transient diplopia and cerebellar dysfunction, followed by dysautonomia, coma and death.These patients are rare codon 129 methionine homozygotes with PrPSc type 2 and predominant thalamic involvement.Microscopically, slight spongiform degeneration but severe neuronal loss with gliosis is present in thalamus and inferior olives, although immunohistochemical detection of PrP mostly shows focal or no positivity.The distribution of the PrPSc-immunoreactive structures is similar in familial and sporadic form.The features useful to distinguish sporadic versus familial form are the absence of a family history and the characteristic Asp178Asn PRNP mutation.1.1.3.Variably Protease-Sensitive PrionopathyVariably protease-sensitive prionopathy (VPSPr) is a relatively recently described prion disease identified in 2008.VPSPr is considered a sporadic form of human prion disease, and patients with all types of polymorphisms at codon 129, however, with a predominance of VV homozygotes, are reported."
242,"Variably Protease-Sensitive PrionopathyVariably protease-sensitive prionopathy (VPSPr) is a relatively recently described prion disease identified in 2008.VPSPr is considered a sporadic form of human prion disease, and patients with all types of polymorphisms at codon 129, however, with a predominance of VV homozygotes, are reported.At the same time, it is stated that VV homozygotes show more developed neuropathological manifestation in the form of plaques than MM homozygotes or MV heterozygotes.The median duration of the disease is 2 years with the clinical predominance of psychiatric signs, aphasia, ataxia, and parkinsonian syndrome or cognitive decline.Neuropathologically, VPSPr is characterized by mild spongiform degeneration lacking areas of confluent spongiform transformation, PrP-immunoreactive ""microplaques"", plus plaque-like deposits.1.2.Acquired CJD 1.2.1.Iatrogenic, Accidentally Transmitted CJDThe iatrogenic form arises during medical or surgical procedures during which pathologically conformed prions are transferred.Iatrogenic CJD is extremely rare, accounting for less than 1% of all CJD cases.Transmission after dura mater grafting, from surgical instruments, after corneal transplantation, deep EEG electrode insertion, human growth hormone and gonadotropin treatment have been described and more than 492 cases have been reported.The incubation time varies widely based on the form of inoculation.Those infected via intracerebral electrodes had an incubation period of 16-28 months, whereas patients infected via peripheral growth hormone injections had a latency of between 5 and 30 years.Patients with iCJD usually present with gait abnormalities and ataxia.Specific diagnostic criteria also exist for iCJD (see Table 2).1.2.2.Variant CJDThe Variant CJD (vCJD) is associated with the consumption of BSE-agent contaminated products.The clinical presentation initially includes psychiatric and behavioral symptoms, with painful paresthesia or dysesthesia; ataxia and dementia develop later.In contrast to sCJD and gCJD cases, EEG usually lacks the periodic pattern, the duration of the disease is usually longer (on average 13-14 months), and florid plaques are often present in the neuropathological findings.The characteristic finding on MRI is an increased bilateral pulvinar signal (with indicated sensitivity 78% and specificity 100%).The thalamic and periaqueductal grey matter high signal, and the remarkable absence of cerebral atrophy are described.In contrast to sporadic and genetic forms of CJD, the presence of PrPSc demonstrated both immunohistochemically and by Western blot was proven in all types of lymphoid tissue (tonsils, lymph nodes, and spleen) in all vCJD cases.For this reason, tonsil biopsy may be used in suspected vCJD cases with corresponding clinical presentation and MRI lacking bilateral pulvinar high signal to confirm probable vCJD diagnosis."
243,"In contrast to sporadic and genetic forms of CJD, the presence of PrPSc demonstrated both immunohistochemically and by Western blot was proven in all types of lymphoid tissue (tonsils, lymph nodes, and spleen) in all vCJD cases.For this reason, tonsil biopsy may be used in suspected vCJD cases with corresponding clinical presentation and MRI lacking bilateral pulvinar high signal to confirm probable vCJD diagnosis.With one exception (one patient with MV genotype), all patients with vCJD were MM homozygotes, in addition, PrPSc type 2 was present in all cases.Interestingly, there are three probable cases of CJD transmission via blood transfusions from a donor suffering from vCJD; for this reason, there is a ban on donors who lived in the United Kingdom during the BSE epidemic.Moreover, there are three recently known (2016, 2018, and 2021 which is under investigation) cases of CJD in former laboratory workers with occupational contact with BSE-infected brain tissue.The diagnostic criteria are summarized below (Table 3).1.2.3.KuruKuru was defined as a neurodegenerative, non-inflammatory infectious disease.Kuru began to appear around 1900 in Papua New Guinea among cannibalistic tribes and the incidence subsequently escalated between 1940-1950.Cerebellar ataxia, tremor, and extrapyramidal symptoms such as chorea and athetosis were typical symptoms of the majority of patients although neuropathological findings varied.No cognitive impairment was present.The neuropathological reports describe myelin and neuronal degeneration (with a maximum in pontine nuclei, cerebellum and basal ganglia), proliferation of microglia and astroglia, mononuclear perivascular infiltration, cuffing, spongiform transformation, shrunken neurons with dispersion of Nissl substance with intracytoplasmic vacuoles, and vacuolated cerebellar Purkinje cells and striatal neurons.Amyloid ""kuru"" plaques were recorded in 50-75% of the examined brains.Currently, kuru disease is considered extinct.1.3.Inherited Prion Diseases1.3.1.Genetic CJDThe genetic/familial form is conditioned by the presence of an inherited mutation in the PRNP gene, which occurs in 10-15% of CJD cases.It is more appropriate to use the term genetic, as not every patient has known positive family history.There are more than 50 known mutations in this gene.In the Czech Republic, the majority of genetic forms involve an E200K mutation, which is also the most common mutation in Europe followed by the V210I and D178N mutations.The most common mutations in Japan are V180I, E200K, and M232R, sorted by frequency.The D178N mutation is relatively common in certain countries in Western Europe, i.e., Netherlands, France, United Kingdom, Finland, and Hungary."
244,"The most common mutations in Japan are V180I, E200K, and M232R, sorted by frequency.The D178N mutation is relatively common in certain countries in Western Europe, i.e., Netherlands, France, United Kingdom, Finland, and Hungary.Dementia is clinically described with other psychiatric changes along with ataxia and myoclonus, however, gaze palsies and neuropathies are rare.The disease penetrance varies from 60 to 100%, relative to population.Similar to sCJD, gCJD has its diagnostic criteria (see Table 4).The course of the disease is usually longer; the 2-year disease duration limitation for sporadic CJD is not applicable in gCJD.1.3.2.Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Syndrome Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS) is defined as a slowly progressive hereditary autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease or an encephalo(myelo)pathy with multicentric PrP plaques in the cerebral and cerebellar cortex and basal ganglia.It is the multicentric plaques that are the neuropathological hallmark of GSS, although the pattern differs among families.GSS is usually manifested by cerebellar ataxia and slowly progressive dementia; nevertheless, extrapyramidal symptoms, vision and hearing impairment, myoclonus, spastic paraparesis, and hyporeflexia or areflexia in the lower extremities have also been reported as common symptoms.Four distinct clinical subtypes among cases with P102L mutation can be distinguished: typical GSS; GSS with areflexia and paresthesia; pure dementia GSS; and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease-like GSS.In addition, GSS was the first human TSE with a known PRNP mutation, which include point mutations at codons 102, 105, 117, 131, 145, 187, 198, 202, 212, 217, and 232 or octapeptide repeat insertions (OPRI) counting 1-9 of 24 base pair multiples.In the Czech Republic, the P102L mutation is the most common.1.3.3.Fatal Familial InsomniaFatal familial insomnia (FFI) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease caused by a mutation D178N in the PRNP gene associated with the presence of the MM polymorphism at codon 129.FFI is characterized by medication-resistant insomnia, sleep fragmentation, disturbances of the autonomic nervous system, motor disorders, and progressive cognitive impairment.The most affected areas are the mediodorsal and anterior ventral thalamic nuclei, followed by the pulvinar and the olives.Extensive neuronal loss and astrocytic gliosis are the main neuropathological findings, whereas spongiform transformations are missing.FFI has not been found in the Czech Republic.1.4."
245,"FFI has not been found in the Czech Republic.1.4.Differential Diagnosis of Human Prion DiseasesThe clinical picture in typical forms of TSEs is relatively specific, and with additional methods (MRI, cerebrospinal fluid examination, RT-QuIC), a high degree of diagnostic certainty can be achieved.Nonetheless, the differential diagnosis needs to consider several main groups (neurodegenerative:pure or comorbid, autoimmune including paraneoplastic, infectious, toxic/metabolic, and tumorous).Primary neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), corticobasal syndrome (CBS), multiple-system atrophy (MSA), motor neuron disease (MND), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and normal-pressure hydrocephalus.However, it is important to point out that ""pure"" forms of neurodegenerative diseases usually do not imitate CJD; however, comorbid cases can (see Table 5).The most common diagnoses possibly clinically mimicking CJD are AD, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), DLB, and tauopathies, more often with, or without comorbid neurodegenerative disease, including less common comorbid neurodegenerations (FTLD+DLB, AD+FTD including Pick disease, AD+PSP).Paraneoplastic syndromes in the form of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration or limbic encephalitis, autoimmune encephalitis, vasculitis, but also Hashimoto thyroiditis complicated by Hashimoto encephalopathy must be included in the group of autoimmune processes that can mimic TSEs.Infectious forms are mainly caused by herpes simplex encephalitis.Hepatic or renal metabolic encephalopathies, as well as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which usually occurs in the chronically malnourished, especially ethylic patients, should be diagnostically considered in cases of rapidly progressive dementias.Clinically, these illnesses can have highly variable presentations.We also noted cases of rapidly progressing dementia with atypical clinical symptoms and clinical suspicion of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in whom the subsequent neuropathological examination revealed the presence of a tumorous infiltration of the brain (primary, secondary, or lymphomatous) or meningeal carcinomatosis.Although the neuropathological diagnosis of isolated prion disease is relatively straightforward, it is necessary to investigate possible co-pathologies in the brain that could modify the clinical, biochemical, and morphological manifestations observed antemortem.The influence of these modifying factors on the profile of biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid is crucial.1.5."
246,"The influence of these modifying factors on the profile of biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid is crucial.1.5.CSF Biomarkers in TSERT-QuIC and 14-3-3 protein analysis are CSF biomarkers routinely used to confirm the diagnosis of probable CJD.1.5.1.Protein 14-3-3 The 14-3-3 proteins are highly expressed in the brain.They are located in the cytoplasmic compartment, intracellular organelles, and in the plasma membrane of neurons.Detection of the 14-3-3 protein in the CSF is part of the WHO diagnostic criteria for probable sCJD.There are seven isoforms of the 14-3-3 protein, only four of them have been detected in the CSF of sCJD patients, and only two (the beta- and gamma-isoform) seem to be suitable biomarkers for a differential diagnosis of sCJD.This biomarker is not only present in the CSF of sCJD patients; it indicates rapid ongoing neuronal destruction in a variety of progressive neurological disorders.Therefore, 14-3-3 positivity is not specific for sCJD, but the test should be indicated when the diagnosis of sCJD is considered.Total (t)-tau can also reflect neuronal destruction and is believed to correlate with the rate of axonal degeneration.Since t-tau levels are dramatically increased in patients with prion diseases, we compared the ROC curves of 14-3-3beta, t-tau, and their combinations in prion vs. non-prion neurodegenerative diseases.The presence of 14-3-3beta was determined using a standardized Western blot protocol (used by all laboratories for the diagnosis of CJD) and followed EURO-CJD standards, with stringent quality control.We performed a standardized qualitative Western blot analysis for 14-3-3beta in duplicates.Levels of t-tau were measured using commercially available enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) kits (INNOTEST hTAU Ag, cat.#80323, Innogenetics/FUJIREBIO and Total-Tau ELISA, cat.#EQ 6531-9601-L, EUROIMMUN) according to the manufacturers' instructions.Comparing 14-3-3 positivity and t-tau levels in prion diseases vs. non-prion diseases using ROC curves, the AUC values were 0.738 and 0.927 (both p < 0.0001), respectively (Figure 1).For 14-3-3 positivity in prion diseases, the sensitivity was 63.1%, and the specificity was 81.1%."

Moreover, RT-QuIC has the ability to detect PrPSc in olfactory mucosa samples or in a skin biopsy.RT-QuIC allows an accurate and rapid diagnosis, which is significant in the differential diagnosis of treatable diseases mimicking TSEs; however, this method has not yet been introduced into clinical practice and remains available only for scientific purposes in the Czech Republic.1.6.Definite Diagnosis of Human Prion DiseasesA definitive diagnosis of TSE is based on the detection of PrPSc in brain tissue usually from brain autopsy.Because Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is not a high priority in differential diagnostic considerations, brain biopsy should be reserved for the search of treatable causes of progressive dementia."
248,"Definite Diagnosis of Human Prion DiseasesA definitive diagnosis of TSE is based on the detection of PrPSc in brain tissue usually from brain autopsy.Because Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is not a high priority in differential diagnostic considerations, brain biopsy should be reserved for the search of treatable causes of progressive dementia.After confirmation of prion disease by Western blot and immunohistochemical methods, molecular genetic testing is routinely performed, aimed at detecting polymorphisms of codon 129 and possible mutations in the PRNP gene in genetic forms.About 15% of prion diseases have a hereditary basis, and in many cases, even in the absence of a relevant family history.Cases of CJD are then divided according to the polymorphism at codon 129 to the three categories: MM homozygotes, VV homozygotes, and MV heterozygotes.According to the size of the proteinase K-resistant core of PrPSc (21 and 19 kDa), type 1 and type 2 of PrPSc is recognized, however, by combination of these techniques we only achieve a division into six subcategories: MM1, MM2, MV1, MV2, VV1, and VV2.Based on histopathological criteria, the subcategory MM2 is subsequently divided into MM2-cortical (MM2-C) and MM2-thalamic (MM2-T) form with characteristic major changes in thalamus and olives.Similarly, subsequent neuropathological criteria for the MV2 cases exists.Predominantly cortical (MV2C) and predominant kuru plaques form (MV2K) are recognized; moreover, a histotype (MV2K+C) sharing both characteristics is also described."
249,"Similarly, subsequent neuropathological criteria for the MV2 cases exists.Predominantly cortical (MV2C) and predominant kuru plaques form (MV2K) are recognized; moreover, a histotype (MV2K+C) sharing both characteristics is also described.MM1/MV1:Spongiform degeneration: formed by fine vacuoles predominantly affecting corticostriatal-thalamic and cerebellar areas, whereas hippocampal region is relatively spared.PrP deposits: prevailing synaptic location.MM2/MV2C:Spongiform degeneration: large confluent vacuoles.PrP deposits: predominant involvement of cortex and subiculum, minor involvement of brainstem with cerebellum.MV2K:PrP deposits: kuru-like plaques mainly in cerebellar granular layer, plaque-like deposits in other cortical regions.VV1:Spongiform degeneration: medium-sized vacuoles involving cortex, striatum, beside spared cerebellar region.PrP deposits: synaptic pattern.VV2:Spongiform degeneration: fine or medium-sized vacuoles; more severe involvement of subcortical grey matter by comparison with cerebral neocortex, and of hippocampus plus subiculum by comparison with occipital cortex.PrP deposits: cerebellar plaque-like structures and perioneuronal pattern in deep cortical layers and hippocampal region.Others: cerebellar atrophy.MM2T (sFI):Spongiform degeneration: absent in cerebellum.Others: moderate to severe selective atrophy of thalamus and olives.MVK+C:Spongiform degeneration: extensive vacuolarization.PrP deposits: same as MV2K (kuru-like plaques mainly in cerebellar granular layer, plaque-like deposits in other cortical regions), in addition with perivacuolar and coarse PrP deposits in the grey matter.Each histotype has its own characteristic histological picture:             Upon detection of PrPSc, the examined tissue is first digested with proteinase K, which degrades physiological PrPC.Subsequently, monoclonal antibodies directed against PrP recognize pathological PrPSc molecules that are resistant to proteinase K digestion.Indirect immunohistochemical methods or Western blot are used as a standard, although RT-QuIC should not be omitted from the list of diagnostic methods.1.6.1.Western Blot Western blot (WB) is more sensitive and faster than immunohistochemical methods.The fixation time of the whole brain is about 3-4 weeks, after which a neuropathological examination can be performed.The time from autopsy to a definitive diagnosis, including the exclusion of other possible neurodegenerative diseases, is therefore around six weeks but can take longer.WB makes it possible to demonstrate the presence of PrPSc on the second day after autopsy.For WB analysis, the frontal lobe is routinely analyzed.Nonetheless, WB analysis provides the basic information about the presence of PrPSc and can only distinguish types (1, 2, 1+2 or 3) of PrPSc."
250,"For WB analysis, the frontal lobe is routinely analyzed.Nonetheless, WB analysis provides the basic information about the presence of PrPSc and can only distinguish types (1, 2, 1+2 or 3) of PrPSc.For complete information about the PrPSc strain, other methods must be performed (see below).Western Blot in Corneal Pre-Transplantation TestingSince the retina and optic nerve are extensions of the central nervous system, the WHO considers them to be a category I: high-infectivity tissue.In the Czech Republic, approximately 500 corneal transplants are carried out each year.Since January 2007, testing all corneal donors for PrPSc is mandatory with the goal of increasing the safety of corneal transplants.For the detection of PrPSc in brain tissue by Western blot, the frontal lobe is routinely analyzed according to WHO guidelines.Complete neuropathological work-up is not performed in corneal donors' brain tissue.Except for a few cases of CJD, no other neuropathies were determined to be transferred during the corneal transplantation to our knowledge.All tests are performed exclusively by the immunological laboratory at the NRL, which cooperates with all eye banks in the Czech Republic.During this time (2007-2020), 6590 samples were tested; all were negative, four were suspected of having PrPSc, but after further investigations, they were also found to be negative.Traceability of donors, through the National Donor Register and the National Transplant Register, for a period of 30 years is ensured by the Transplantation Act.To the best of our knowledge, the Czech Republic is the only country in the world where legislation requires Western blot tests of brain tissue from every eye tissue donor..In neighboring Slovakia, where gCJD accounts for 74.2% of cases (compared to 16.28% in the Czech Republic), determination of the codon 129 genotype together with detection of the E200K mutation is the method of choice for corneal donors testing.1.6.2.ImmunohistochemistryAn immunohistochemical examination determines the distribution of PrPSc in different parts of the brain as well as the morphology of immunoreactive structures since PrPSc may occur in the form of plaques, plaque-like structures or diffuse synaptic deposits.According to WHO criteria, one of the above methods is enough to confirm a definitive diagnosis of prion disease, although a combination of both is recommended.A complete definitive diagnosis of prion disease has three parts, i.e., neuropathological, immunological (Western blot), and molecular genetics.Only a combination of these approaches can provide a definitive diagnosis of sporadic or genetic prion disease.1.6.3."
251,"Only a combination of these approaches can provide a definitive diagnosis of sporadic or genetic prion disease.1.6.3.Genetic Testing Among the diagnosed cases in the Czech Republic, the distribution of polymorphisms at codon 129 is 60% methionine homozygosity (MM), 24% methionine/valine heterozygosity, and 16% valine homozygosity (VV); additionally, approximately 16% of cases are due to an inherited mutation in the PRNP gene.A common coding polymorphism at codon 129 in PRNP between methionine and valine (c.385A>G) plays a critical role in susceptibility to prion diseases with homozygotes (i.e., MM or VV) being at higher risk.Easier dimerization and oligomerization of PrP homozygotes compared to heterozygotes is an important factor in the pathogenesis of prion diseases.In total, approximately 50 mutations of the PRNP gene have been described around the world.The most common mutations in the PRNP gene in the Czech population are E200K, D178N, R208H, and P102L, as well as del/ins in the repetitive sequence.The general penetration of these mutations increases with age, and in some populations reaches 100% after the age of 85; in others, for example, in Slovakia or Italy, penetration is up to 60%.The E200K mutation is the most widespread in the Czech Republic (30 cases), as well as in Slovakia, from where it was transferred to the Czech Republic.The D178N mutation was found in two cases.The clinical phenotype in those cases was influenced by the polymorphism at codon 129 since the D178N mutation with valine at codon 129 causes gCJD.If methionine is present at codon 129, fatal familial insomnia develops.The genetic background of D178N could be clinically missed; for genetic counselling purposes, however, the mutation can be detected from samples of the archived tissue.The P102L mutation was found in eight cases, and no clinically specific symptoms for this mutation were observed, although we described a case mimicking gCJD.The R208H mutation is very rare, and one family harboring this mutation was discovered in the Czech Republic in relation to a case mimicking progressive supranuclear palsy.Del/ins of two or more octapeptide repeats is considered pathogenic since octapeptide repeat insertions increase the rate of protease-resistant PrP formations.The clinical phenotype is highly variable, often blending features of both CJD and GSS disease or sometimes even lacking specific histopathological changes.Patients with insertional mutations usually display signs of illness early in life that last for several years."
252,"The clinical phenotype is highly variable, often blending features of both CJD and GSS disease or sometimes even lacking specific histopathological changes.Patients with insertional mutations usually display signs of illness early in life that last for several years.The molecular basis for this phenotypic heterogeneity remains elusive but seems to depend on the size of the base pair insertion and the codon 129 polymorphism.2.Human Prion Diseases in the Czech Republic 2001-2020:Results from a Nation-Wide Survey2.1.Numbers of Detected Cases Autopsy verification of all suspected prion diseases is mandatory in the Czech Republic and is governed by hygienic-epidemiological surveillance.Data obtained regarding possible cases from clinical neurologists and subsequently confirmed cases are registered with the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) for Human Prion Diseases at the Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Thomayer University Hospital, Prague, CZ.Autopsies are provided by the NRL with clinically suspected neurodegenerations making up about one-third of performed autopsies done in the department.The NRL is the only reference center for neuropathology verification of prion disease in the Czech Republic so that the data represents the official results of prion surveillance in our country and consists of definitively neuropathologically confirmed cases.From 2001 to 2020, a total of 305 cases of prion diseases were definitively confirmed, of which 256 cases were sCJD, 41 cases were gCJD, and 8 cases were GSS (see Figure 2), which corresponds to a total prevalence of approximately 15.25 cases per year.No cases of vCJD or FFI have ever been detected in the Czech Republic.Not all the brain samples referred to the NRL as possible/probable CJD were confirmed as definite CJD.Many other diagnostic entities were detected during autopsy, including neurodegenerations (in most cases comorbid), tumors, and autoimmune disorders (Table 5).There is an apparent trend towards an increasing prevalence of TSEs due to the optimization of diagnostic methods, and in part by the fact that the NRL is headquartered at the Department of Neurology at Thomayer University Hospital, which provides consultations intra vitam in suspected cases for the whole of the Czech Republic.The increasing prevalence is well illustrated by the fact that in the first ten years (2001-2010) of the NRL's existence, 115 cases of human prion diseases were detected, 88 of which have no hereditary background.However, over the next ten years (2011-2020), the number of confirmed TSE cases increased to 190, with 168 sporadic cases."
253,"The increasing prevalence is well illustrated by the fact that in the first ten years (2001-2010) of the NRL's existence, 115 cases of human prion diseases were detected, 88 of which have no hereditary background.However, over the next ten years (2011-2020), the number of confirmed TSE cases increased to 190, with 168 sporadic cases.This was an increase of 90.91% in detected sporadic cases over ten years, according to the predicted increase of diagnosed cases if surveillance was more intensive.Nevertheless, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we noticed a slight decrease in the number of diagnosed patients suffering from TSEs; it was the fewest detected cases of sCJD since 2012.We speculate that this could be partly due to the greater burden on hospitals during the pandemic, which led to a reduction in TSE surveillance.Considering incidence, in individual regions it ranges from 0.9 to 2.3 cases per million inhabitants (Figure 3), which is consistent with the worldwide numbers.The differences between individual regions are usually not significant and correlate with the existence of specialized neurological centers in the area.The age range in our cohort of patients is 39-69 years in GSS, 46-74 years in gCJD and 40-87 years in sCJD, which corresponds to a median age of 60.5 years in GSS, 56.5 years in gCJD and 67 years in sCJD.Thus, patients with the sporadic form have a higher median age than patients with genetically based TSEs (see Supplementary Material).2.2.CJD in Comorbidity There are many reports indicating that CJD very often occurs in comorbidity with other neurodegenerative diseases.Kovacs et al.stated that the most common comorbidities with sCJD are tauopathies, such as primary age-related tauopathy, aging-related tau astrogliopathy, and argyrophilic grain disease (PART, ARTAG, and AGD, respectively).Our experience also supports these observations; in our cohort, approximately 62% of patients had sCJD or gCJD with a comorbid tauopathy, most often PART.The next most common comorbidity was Alzheimer's disease, of which there are twice as many as pure CJD cases.Less common combinations include CJD+FTLD and CJD+DLB, which were rarely observed.We investigated the genetic background of the various comorbidities; however, our pilot study failed to find any important relationships.2.3.Brain Biopsy During our 20 years of experience, a brain biopsy was rarely indicated.As mentioned above, brain biopsies are reserved for cases with a clinical suspicion of CJD associated with iatrogenic transmission (resulting from irreversible contamination of surgical instruments), and since CJD is incurable, a brain biopsy is the ultimum refugium in cases where the differential diagnosis includes a treatable disease.3."

262,"Why do SARS-CoV-2 NSPs rush to the ER?SARS-CoV-2, which led to the 2020 global pandemic, is responsible for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory illness, and presents a tropism for the central nervous system.Like most members of this family, the virus is composed of structural and non-structural proteins (NSPs).The non-structural proteins are critical elements of the replication and transcription complex (RTC), as well as immune system evasion.Through hijacking the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, NSPs help the virus establish the RTC, inducing ER stress after membrane rearrangement and causing severe neuronal disturbance.In this review, we focus on the role of Nsp3, 4, and 6 in intracellular membrane rearrangement and evaluate the potential disruption of the central nervous system and the neurodegeneration which it could trigger.Studies of these NSPs will not only bring to light their specific role in viral infection but also facilitate the discovery of novel targeted drugs.BackgroundSince the discovery of the first coronaviruses (CoV) by Tyrrell and Bynoe in 1965, more strains have emerged.Only two circulating human coronaviruses (HCoVs), HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, were described as the frequent cause of the common cold until 2002–2003 when the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV spread into the human population in China.Then, two new coronaviruses, CoV NL63 in 2004 (alphacoronavirus) and HKU1 in 2005 (betacoronavirus), were discovered.Another coronavirus, the MERS-CoV, emerged in the Middle East and engenders lower respiratory tract infections with high mortality.HCoVs were considered relatively harmless until the SARS outbreak in 2003, where they appeared clinically for the first time as a severe respiratory illness with high mortality and morbidity.Coronaviruses have been identified to infect a wide variety of animals, birds, and mammals, including mice, cats, bats, dogs, pangolins, as well as humans, with a diversity of clinical presentation including respiratory tract infection and gastroenteritis.The outbreaks of SARS and MERS and the frequent re-introduction of coronaviruses in the human population increased the awareness of the danger of emergence of other zoonotic coronaviral infections.These epidemics indicate the need to develop antiviral compounds to combat coronavirus infections."
263,"The outbreaks of SARS and MERS and the frequent re-introduction of coronaviruses in the human population increased the awareness of the danger of emergence of other zoonotic coronaviral infections.These epidemics indicate the need to develop antiviral compounds to combat coronavirus infections.However, gaps still exist in the knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis and transmissivity of this family of viruses.CoVs belong to the Nidovirales order—Coronaviridae family—and received their names from the unique “crown-like” spikes that are visible on the outer membrane of the virions.Coronaviruses are large enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses that are broken down into four classes: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Deltacoronavirus.Coronaviruses are the largest RNA viruses known with a genome ranging between 27 and 32 kb.Like all the Nidovirales members, Coronaviruses have a highly conserved genomic organization, unique enzymatic activities, and express non-structural genes by ribosomal frameshifting.Viral replication and structureStructure of SARS-CoV-2.Schematic representation of SARS-CoV-2 structure where all the open reading frames (Orfs) and non-structural proteins (NSPs) positions are indicated.Cleavage sites processed by the papain-like proteinase are indicated by blue arrowheads and the 3C-like proteinase are indicated by red arrowheadsSARS-CoV-2 contains a 30 kb genome encoding 14 open reading frames (Orfs) where each encodes several proteins (structural and non-structural) (Fig. 1).The first non-structural proteins (NSPs) encoded by Orf1a/Orf1ab are Papain-like proteinase (PL proteinase, Nps3) and 3-chymotrypsin-like proteinase (3CLPro protease).The PL proteinase Nsp3 cleaves NSPs 1 to 3 and the 3CLPro proteinase slices the C-terminus from Nsp4 to Nsp16 in all coronaviruses.Orf1a gene is expressed early and translated into a polyprotein that will be cleaved into 11 non-structural proteins (Nsp1-11) by the papain-like activity of Nsp3 or by Nsp5, which possess a chymotrypsin-like protease activity.Orf1ab is in a different frame from Orf1a and the virus uses programmed-1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) to synthesize it.Replication and transcription of the virus happen within a replication/transcription complex (RTC) encoded by the virus with NSPs as primary constituents.Nearly all RTC elements are encoded by the large replicase gene that consists of Orf1a and Orf1ab."
264,"Orf1ab is in a different frame from Orf1a and the virus uses programmed-1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) to synthesize it.Replication and transcription of the virus happen within a replication/transcription complex (RTC) encoded by the virus with NSPs as primary constituents.Nearly all RTC elements are encoded by the large replicase gene that consists of Orf1a and Orf1ab.The early formation of the RTC is an essential step in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle to safeguard viral genome replication and to synthesize subgenomic mRNA.The RTC comprises multiple proteins; the non-structural proteins Nsp3, Nsp4, and Nsp6 that participate in the formation of sites for viral RNA synthesis, the principal protease (Nsp5), the Nsp7–Nsp8 primase complex, the main RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Nsp12), the helicase/triphosphatase (Nsp13), the exoribonuclease (Nsp14), the endonuclease (Nsp15), and the N7- and 2′O- methyltransferases (Nsp10/Nsp16).The replicase-transcriptase proteins are expected to be great targets for anti-coronaviral drugs.Nsp3 is the largest element of the RTC.In addition to cleaving, Nsp3 alters cytokine expression to decrease the host innate immune response.Nsp5 is a 3CLPro protease crucial for RNA replication.Nsp3, Nsp4, and Nsp6 form a complex to induce double-membrane vesicles.Nsp7 and Nsp8 form an RNA polymerase complex performing de novo initiation and primer extension.Nsp8 interacts with the replicase Nsp9, and with the Orf6 accessory protein.In addition, four structural proteins: Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) are encoded at the 3′-end.Eleven Orfs and 8 postulated accessory factors are also part of the virus structure.Formation of double-membrane vesicles by Nsp3-4-6To evade detection by host innate immune sensors, many viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm compartmentalize their genome transcription in organelle-like structures, thus protecting the virus against host cell defenses and increasing the replication efficiency.Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses and, as such, arrogate intracellular membranes of different cellular organelles.The membrane rearrangements can be an invagination towards the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or other organelles, or an extrusion of the ER membrane forming double-membrane vesicles (DMVs).Outer membranes of DMVs interconnect with the ER and other virus-induced structures called convoluted membranes (CM).The ER is probably the main donor for this elaborate Reticulovesicular Network (RVN), but autophagosomes and late endosomes can also be a membrane source of DMVs."
265,"Outer membranes of DMVs interconnect with the ER and other virus-induced structures called convoluted membranes (CM).The ER is probably the main donor for this elaborate Reticulovesicular Network (RVN), but autophagosomes and late endosomes can also be a membrane source of DMVs.The formation of replication sites most likely emerges from the ER membrane, while the major budding sites of SARS- CoV use the membranes in the ERGIC and Golgi region.Nsp3/4/6 domain similarities.Transmembrane domains were determined by CCTop software (http://cctop.enzim.ttk.mta.hu/).The 1D and 2D panels show the amino acid sequence colored by the consensus topology.Colors are based on the localization: gray, black, blue, red, yellow, and orange for transit sequence, signal peptide, extra-cytosolic, cytosolic, membrane, and re-entrant loop regions, respectivelyThe co-expression of all three SARS-CoV NSPs (Nsp3, Nsp4, and Nsp6) is essential to induce DMVs that are comparable to those described in SARS-CoV-infected cells (Fig. 2).These proteins contain particular multiple transmembrane domains that help the virus replication complex via the recruitment of intracellular membranes.The rough ER outer membrane forms an RVN of membranes that includes convoluted membranes and DMVs.DMVs are found in hepatitis C, poliovirus, coxsackievirus, and SARS-CoV infected cells.Therefore, knowing how the virus uses the host cell to hide in DMVs and replicate will lead to the development of therapies, not only against human CoV but against other pathogens that use the same mechanism, as well.In this regard, K22 was identified as a small compound targeting membrane-bound coronaviral RNA synthesis inhibiting DMV formation, viral replication, and infectivity in a wide range of coronaviruses HCoV-229E, FCoV, MHV, IBV, MERS, and SARS-CoV.Phylogenetic trees.Based on sequence alignment, we built a phylogenetic trees of Nsp3 (a), Nsp4 (b), and Nsp6 (c) for coronaviruses strains OC43, 229E, MERS, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 acquired with Clustal Omega and MView visualizationNSP3 is a 215-kDa glycosylated protein with transmembrane domains interacting with several proteins involved in transcription and replication, and also serves as a scaffolding protein for these mechanisms.Nsp3 contains two conserved transmembrane regions that insert into the ER membrane.These transmembrane domains are required for the DMVs’ pairing (Fig. 3a)."
266,"Nsp3 contains two conserved transmembrane regions that insert into the ER membrane.These transmembrane domains are required for the DMVs’ pairing (Fig. 3a).Exogenous Nsp3, both full length and/or the C-terminal transmembrane-containing region, induces disordered membrane bodies (DMB) as well as multilamellar and giant vesiculation (MGV), showing the ability for the C-terminus to participate in membrane production or expansion of existing membranes.In SARS-infected cells, Nsp3 stimulates membrane buildups that grow larger in size with time supporting.Expression of Nsp3 with either Nsp4 or Nsp6 reduces the formation of MGV but not DMB, indicating that Nsp4 and Nsp6 have a regulatory role on Nsp3′s membrane proliferation ability.Co-transfection of Nsp3 with Nsp4 provokes a particular membrane conformation, generating a perinuclear double-membrane walled maze-like body (MLB), suggesting a significant interaction between Nsp3 and Nsp4 and supporting published data.The C-terminal one-third of Nsp3 (nsp3C) is sufficient to interact with Nsp4 and Nsp6.NSP4Glycosylated Nsp4 is necessary for normal DMV formation, as described in SARS-CoV and MHV.The N-terminal region of Nsp4 comprising the first three transmembrane regions necessary for DMV membrane pairing.We observe in Fig.3b that they are highly conserved among all coronaviruses as well as in SARS-CoV-2 Nsp4.The interaction between Nsp3 and Nsp4 was shown to be necessary for the formation of convoluted membranes (CM) and DMVs in MERS and SARS-CoV, probably through the luminal loops of Nsp3 and Nsp4 positioned in the TM1 and TM2 regions, respectively.The interaction of these domains with their counterparts on the opposite side of the ER lumen induces membrane pairing.The N-terminal region of Nsp3 is required for complete DMVs formation and its TM1 region along with Nsp4 is sufficient to induce membrane pairing.NSP6 is a membrane protein of approximately 34 kDa with six transmembrane helices and a highly conserved C-terminus (Fig. 3c).Inserted in the ER membrane, it associates with Nsp3 and Nsp4 multi-pass transmembrane proteins during the assembly of coronavirus replication complex to form DMVs.Transfection of Nsp6 produces single-membrane small vesicle clustering around the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC).Interestingly, its co-transfection with Nsp4 has a negative effect on this phenotype and Nsp6 is relocalized outside the MTOC area."
267,"Transfection of Nsp6 produces single-membrane small vesicle clustering around the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC).Interestingly, its co-transfection with Nsp4 has a negative effect on this phenotype and Nsp6 is relocalized outside the MTOC area.The microtubule scaffolding does not seem necessary for productive infection; however, several members of the RTC circulate in the cell through the microtubules.The avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) Nsp6 has been shown to activate autophagosome formation, inducing vesicles containing Atg5 and LC3-II, and it shares this property with Nsp6 of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV.All the Nsp6 orthologs throughout the Nidovirales order preserved the ability to engender autophagosomes directly from the ER.However, the autophagosomes formed by Nsp6 have smaller sizes compared with those induced by starvation, suggesting that Nsp6 might also inhibit the enlargement of autophagosomes.The mechanisms behind Nsp6-induced autophagy are poorly described, even though involvement of mTOR and the ER stress transcription factor CHOP are neutralized.Nsp6 may modify adaptive immune responses by sending immunomodulatory proteins synthesized by the ER into autophagosomes for degradation.The SARS-CoV-2 Nsp6 protein also interacts with the sigma receptor, which is known to participate in ER stress response.Effect of coronaviruses on neuronsSARS-CoVThe histological examination of brain tissue harvested during the 2003 SARS epidemic has shown degeneration and necrosis of neurons, extensive glial cell hyperplasia, edema, and cellular infiltration.Electron microscopy studies detected viral genomes and viral particles in the cytoplasm of neurons, mostly in the cortex and the hippocampus, confirming that the virus can cross the blood–brain barrier.Interestingly, in patients infected with SARS-CoV, the virus localized almost exclusively to neurons.This observation is congruent with studies showing a distinct neuronal tropism in infected hACE2-Tg mice.Moreover, human neurons are susceptible to SARS-CoV and express ACE2.Note that at least four known coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) possess the property to penetrate the central nervous system (CNS).SARS-CoV-2The great structural similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronaviruses brings the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 also possesses similar neurotrophic and neuro-invasive properties.Furthermore, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the same host receptor, the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).It is proposed that the virus enter the CNS through different routes including the olfactory and trigeminal nerves, the cerebrospinal fluid, the vasculature, and the lymphatic system.The central respiratory failure observed with some patients may be partially due to the neuro-invasive potential of the virus."
268,"Furthermore, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the same host receptor, the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).It is proposed that the virus enter the CNS through different routes including the olfactory and trigeminal nerves, the cerebrospinal fluid, the vasculature, and the lymphatic system.The central respiratory failure observed with some patients may be partially due to the neuro-invasive potential of the virus.It has the ability to damage the brainstem where the pneumotaxic center is located, and hence, endotracheal intubation and mechanical respiratory support may be needed.A recent study registered neurological manifestations in 214 patients, of which 78 patients (36.4%) had neurologic manifestations, showing a neurotropic potential for the SARS-CoV-2.Furthermore, about 8% of patients from Wuhan-China reported headaches and 5% nausea and vomiting.Edema and partial neuronal degeneration were observed in brain tissues in China and many cases of viral encephalitis in different countries were registered.It is too premature to know the long-term neurological complications of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and coronaviruses have not been linked so far with particular long-term neurological sequelae.However, the long-term neurocognitive consequences of SARS-CoV-2 should not be ignored.Additionally, the presence of anosmia and ageusia is intriguing, since hyposmia is a feature of early Parkinson’s disease and the accumulation of alpha-synuclein in the olfactory system is often seen in the prodrome.Several studies suggest that HCoV RNA frequently persists in human brains, as was observed for murine coronaviruses.The neurotropism of HCoV could lead to persistence within the central nervous system.Consequences of interfering with intracellular membranesCoronavirus can provoke ER stressA healthy and functional ER is vital for the synthesis of new plasma membrane proteins, lysosomal enzymes, proteins for the Golgi apparatus, and proteins for extracellular secretion.Any alteration in its function can provoke ER stress and accumulation of misfolded proteins that could lead to cellular deregulation and diseases.In this regard, global proteomic studies revealed that several genes related to ER stress are overexpressed in cells infected with SARS- CoV, such as glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78 or BiP) and glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94).ER stress can also be activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines.Several SARS-CoV proteins have been shown to induce the ER stress response such as the Spike protein, upregulating GRP78/94 and the PERK pathway, while 3a and 8ab proteins were shown to induce lysosomal damage.Orf6 and Orf7a were also described to induce ER stress, where Orf6 activates caspase-3 through JNK-dependent apoptosis pathway.However, nothing is known about SARS-CoV-2 proteins.Some of these events could be observed, because at least one domain (N- or C-terminal) of BiP, CHOP, or other involved ER factors belong to the group of intrinsically disordered proteins."
269,"However, nothing is known about SARS-CoV-2 proteins.Some of these events could be observed, because at least one domain (N- or C-terminal) of BiP, CHOP, or other involved ER factors belong to the group of intrinsically disordered proteins.Any deregulation of one of the domains can alter that protein function and contributes to ER stress.This phenomenon is mainly assured by SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein that associates with the other viral proteins to induce these deregulations.The ER-associated degradation (ERAD) tuning vesicles (or EDEMosomes) controls the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins.EDEMosomes are large vesicles budding from the ER that fuse in an Atg5-dependent manner with lysosomes for degradation of their contents.Coronavirus hijacks the machinery of EDEMososme formation for the production of DMVs.Viral NSPs associate with an EDEMosome cargo receptor that usually organizes the sorting of EDEMososmes from the ER.Furthermore, the unfolded protein response (UPR) maintains ER homeostasis by shutting down the translation and increasing the ER protein folding capacity.However, under sustained ER stress, the UPR can induce apoptotic cell death and cytokine production.The UPR also stimulates transcription of genes encoding proteins that mediate ERAD.Chronic UPR activation has been described in many diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and neurodegeneration.Coronavirus might promote Golgi fragmentationProteins synthesized in the ER are packaged into vesicles that will fuse with the Golgi apparatus.These cargo proteins are modified and destined for secretion via exocytosis or for use in the cell.The Golgi is also involved in lipid transport and lysosome formation.Therefore, provoking its fragmentation can cause the cell to collapse.In this regard, it has been shown that SARS-CoV and MHV infections trigger the rearrangement and fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus.The Golgi complex usually forms a continuous ribbon in mammalian cells and its alteration causes a stress response resulting in cell death.Coronavirus may alter autophagy machineryViruses can use autophagy machinery for their own replication and have also developed strategies to escape autophagic degradation.Recent evidence suggests an inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV and MERS on the autophagy process.MERS blocks the autophagosome/lysosome fusion and causes the suppression of the autophagic flux.However, it was not elucidated if this blockage is mandatory for viral replication.Three MERS proteins are described to limit autophagy, Nsp6, p4b, and p5, with Nsp6 also inhibiting the expansion of autophagosomes as shown for other betacoronaviruses.The actual induction of autophagy in infected cells could be due to other factors, such as the presence of double-stranded RNA within the cell, activation of toll receptor signaling during cell entry, and/or induction of ER stress during replication and envelopment."
270,"Three MERS proteins are described to limit autophagy, Nsp6, p4b, and p5, with Nsp6 also inhibiting the expansion of autophagosomes as shown for other betacoronaviruses.The actual induction of autophagy in infected cells could be due to other factors, such as the presence of double-stranded RNA within the cell, activation of toll receptor signaling during cell entry, and/or induction of ER stress during replication and envelopment.Therefore, it is important to study these events in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and to determine a) which SARS-CoV02 proteins are involved in ER stress, b) what is the impact of this stress on cell function, and c) can these events be reversed to prevent viral replication.Potential long-term consequences of coronaviruses on the central nervous systemSeveral studies have linked the presence and persistence of coronavirus in human brains to long-term sequelae with the initiation or exacerbation of chronic neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson’s disease.The neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain JHM RNA has been found in both the rodent models and human CNS for extended periods after the initial infection.Oligodendrocytes and most likely neurons are potential reservoirs for the coronavirus infection.Human respiratory pathogens have been recognized to be associated with the initiation or aggravation of neurological diseases, but the etiology is still poorly understood.A persistent HCoV- 229E infection was observed in the brains from different age groups after autopsy and may play a role in further chronic pathologies witnessed with coronoviral infections.HCoV-OC43 was shown to establish a persistent infection in human cells, and was detected in the CNS of mice a year after an infection that triggered acute encephalitis.Based on studies using SARS-CoV and/or other viruses, researchers suggest two pathways to explain how SARS-CoV-2 can enter the human CNS: i—the hematogenous entry, and/or ii—the neuronal retrograde dissemination.Hematogenous entryIn the hematogenous entry, endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier (BBB) or leukocytes are infected by the virus to infiltrate the CNS.SARS-CoV infects endothelial cells of the BBB “channeling a passage” through the BBB into the CNS.In the same way, HCoV-229E infects monocytes/macrophages, peritoneal macrophages, and dendritic cells.Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 may infect monocytes and macrophages through ACE2-dependent and ACE2-independent pathways or attach to ACE2 expressed in the endothelium of BBB to obtain access into the CNS.The angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 receptor is widely distributed in the lungs, heart, liver, kidney, and intestine.After the infection, monocytes migrate to the tissues where they turn into infected resident macrophages, permitting viruses to reach different organs and tissues."
271,"The angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 receptor is widely distributed in the lungs, heart, liver, kidney, and intestine.After the infection, monocytes migrate to the tissues where they turn into infected resident macrophages, permitting viruses to reach different organs and tissues.Cerebral cytokine storms can result in the breakdown of the BBB and allow monocytes to traverse the BBB physically.In support of this pathway, studies showed a significant heterogeneity in the range of estimates for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood, from 0% in numerous studies, and even up to 76% in a critical care setting.Pooled data estimated that SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detected at low copy numbers in about 10% of blood samples from patients with COVID-19.Neuronal retrograde disseminationThe second major access to the CNS for SARS-CoV-2 could be via a nerve terminal.By this means, some viruses can infect peripheric neurons and enter the CNS via a retrograde axonal transport machinery to the soma.ACE2 is broadly expressed on the epithelial cells of the oral mucosa.SARS-CoV penetrates the brains of hACE2 mice mostly through the olfactory bulb, before spreading to the brain.Olfactory sensory neurons extend dendrites into the nasal cavity and spread out axons across the cribriform plate into the olfactory bulb of the brain.From the lungs, SARS-CoV-2 could spread into the CNS by trans-neural route, through the vagus nerve and the dorsal root ganglia.The trans‐synaptic transfer has been well described for other coronaviruses, such as HEV67 and influenza a.These pathways and their impacts confirm the need for a long-term assessment of neurological damage in the care of SARS-CoV-2 patients.Multiple sclerosis is a disease of unidentified etiology associated with idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system.It is interesting to note that contact with infectious pathogens before puberty seems to increase the risk of developing MS and relapses of the disease are often preceded with respiratory tract infection.Coronavirus-like particles, HCoV RNA, and intrathecal anti-HCoV antibody synthesis indicative of a CNS infection, were detected in autopsied brain tissues from MS patients.In rodents, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection of the CNS triggers neurological symptoms similar to MS. A cross-reactivity between myelin and coronavirus antigens was noticed in T-cell lines isolated from MS patients.Parkinson’s diseaseA potential relationship or at least an epidemiological association between viral infections and PD was first mentioned after the 1920–1930s influenza epidemic, which was associated with Encephalitis Lethargica (EL).The EL patients presented a type of ‘sleeping sickness’ which included uncontrollable sleepiness but also headache, nausea, fever, catatonia, and occasionally coma."

277,"Understanding Post Entry Sorting of Adenovirus Capsids; A Chance to Change Vaccine Vector PropertiesAdenovirus vector-based genetic vaccines have emerged as a powerful strategy against the SARS-CoV-2 health crisis.This success is not unexpected because adenoviruses combine many desirable features of a genetic vaccine.They are highly immunogenic and have a low and well characterized pathogenic profile paired with technological approachability.Ongoing efforts to improve adenovirus-vaccine vectors include the use of rare serotypes and non-human adenoviruses.In this review, we focus on the viral capsid and how the choice of genotypes influences the uptake and subsequent subcellular sorting.We describe how understanding capsid properties, such as stability during the entry process, can change the fate of the entering particles and how this translates into differences in immunity outcomes.We discuss in detail how mutating the membrane lytic capsid protein VI affects species C viruses' post-entry sorting and briefly discuss if such approaches could have a wider implication in vaccine and/or vector development.1.IntroductionViral infections, unlike bacterial infections that can be treated with antibiotics, remain a threat to health as very few antiviral remedies exist.Therefore, vaccination is the only widely applicable strategy to protect human (and animal) populations from viral infections.Until recently, vaccination against viral infections was mainly considered in the context of preventing childhood diseases or as the annual ""flu"" shot for influenza infection prevention.With the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 health crisis in 2020, vaccination has returned to the center of public attention as it is now seen as the only sustainable way out of this pandemic.In this context, adenovirus (Ad) vector-based vaccines have emerged as one of two major successful vaccination strategies.Following emergency approval, Ad vaccines are now being injected to a large proportion of the earth's population in an unprecedented effort to install planetary immunity against SARS-CoV-2.Adenovirus vector vaccines were not widely used before the COVID-19 outbreak, but their success is not unexpected.Viruses are in general very suitable vaccine platforms.They are biologically optimized and adapted for nucleic acid transport, and they elicit immune responses.Adenoviruses have many features that make them particularly ideal vaccine candidates.They have a low and well-characterized pathogenic profile paired with a high infectivity.They are technologically approachable and have been extensively used for vectorization.Their high production yield and stability allow industrial production under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions and provide practical features (i.e., storage) for regional distribution at a reduced cost."
278,"They are technologically approachable and have been extensively used for vectorization.Their high production yield and stability allow industrial production under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions and provide practical features (i.e., storage) for regional distribution at a reduced cost.Furthermore, Ad cell delivery into antigen-presenting cells is efficient, and they naturally provoke an innate immune response that acts as an adjuvant to boost vaccination success.Understanding Ad biology has been crucial in developing Ad-based (vaccine) vectors.For example, the use of non-human or rare Ad serotypes in some of the currently marketed SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was deliberately chosen to prevent pre-existing vector immunity from reducing vaccine efficiency.The use of viral gene-deleted vectors provides improved vector safety.However, there are still many aspects of the viral life cycle that have not been considered when developing Ad-based vaccine vectors, and knowledge on rare or non-human genotypes is limited, including the ones currently used as SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.With this review, we would like to raise awareness for potential modifications that could be exploited when developing Ad vectors for medical purposes including vaccination.We focus on the viral capsid and how the choice of genotypes influences the uptake und subsequent subcellular sorting.We describe how understanding capsid properties such as stability during the entry process can change the fate of the entering particles and what different immunity outcomes are observed.As an example of how capsid stability and fate can be changed, we discuss in detail how mutating the membrane lytic capsid protein VI affects species C viruses.Finally, we briefly discuss if such approaches have the potential to be exploited for vaccine and/or vector development.1.1.Adenoviruses Constitute a Diverse Family of Infectious PathogensHistorically, Ad was first isolated in 1953 from adenoids of patients with respiratory infections, and soon after, the term ""adenovirus"" was universally adopted.The family of Adenoviridae has more than 120 members, divided into five genera:depending on whether they infect mammals (e.g., Mastadenoviridae), birds (e.g., Aviadenoviridae), reptiles (e.g., Atadenoviridae), amphibians (Siadenoviridae), or fish (Ichtadenoviridae).The genus Mastadenoviridae also accounts for more than 70 types of human Ads, which are classified into seven species (A-G), according to their morphological, biological, and physicochemical properties, as listed in Table 1.Furthermore, Ads can also spontaneously recombine, thereby generating new species, as it was the case for AdE4, which is the only human species E virus and is likely to have resulted from the recombination between human species B and a simian Ad."
279,"The genus Mastadenoviridae also accounts for more than 70 types of human Ads, which are classified into seven species (A-G), according to their morphological, biological, and physicochemical properties, as listed in Table 1.Furthermore, Ads can also spontaneously recombine, thereby generating new species, as it was the case for AdE4, which is the only human species E virus and is likely to have resulted from the recombination between human species B and a simian Ad.Although infections in humans with non-human Ads are naturally rare, they are not impossible.The capacity of a variety of non-human Ads to infect (or transduce) human cells makes them attractive (vaccine) vector platforms.Among them are Ads derived from chimpanzees, gorilla, sheep, cow, dog, or the new world monkey.Adenovirus infections can cause different pathologies depending on their cellular or tissue tropism including respiratory, ocular, urinary, or gastrointestinal diseases (see Table 1).Tissue tropism is often the result of distinct receptor usage by different Ads and may also be related to intrinsic particle stability.Most infections with Ads are mild or asymptomatic in an immune-competent host.Primary Ad infections are mostly occurring during childhood and result in strong protective immunity.In contrast, in immune-suppressed individuals, Ads can cause uncontrolled, severe, and life-threatening systemic infections leading to serious cell toxicity, which can result in excessive inflammation and multiple organ failure, causing high mortality.The best-studied human Ads are the species C viruses type 2 and 5, which are predominantly found in patients with upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections and which will be in the major focus of this review.Adenoviruses can be responsible for occasional outbreaks, such as species B viruses causing pneumonia (e.g., Ad3, 7, and 14) among immune-competent individuals or Ad40/41 of species F and Ad12, 18, and 31 of species A, which infect the gastrointestinal tract (as reviewed in).Species D viruses are a very diverse group and prone to recombination and are a leading cause of eye infections.1.2.Adenovirus Capsids Are Metastable StructuresDespite their diversity, all Ads follow a similar structural and organizational framework.Adenoviruses are non-enveloped DNA viruses containing a relatively large, 26-45 kb linear double-stranded DNA genome.The capsid is ~70-90 nm in diameter and has the form of an icosahedron with 20 facets and 12 vertices.The capsid consists of three major structural proteins (hexon, penton, and fiber) and a variety of minor cement proteins (i.e., IIIa, VI, VIII, and IX in species C viruses) that stabilize the structure.The high-resolution structure of several Ad capsids has been obtained by cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography.The icosahedral capsid has a pseudo T25 structure with 720 hexons assembled in different trimers depending on their location in the capsid."
280,"The high-resolution structure of several Ad capsids has been obtained by cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography.The icosahedral capsid has a pseudo T25 structure with 720 hexons assembled in different trimers depending on their location in the capsid.The 20 facets of the capsid are composed of nine assembled hexons (so called GON for Group of Nine), whereas at the 12 vertices, hexons are assembled in GOS (for Group of Six) (see for more details).The pentameric penton base is inserted into the 12 vertices and serves as the basis for the protruding trimeric fiber.The interaction between major and minor capsid proteins stabilizes the capsid, mainly through the interaction with hexons.For example, GON are stabilized by IX; IX and IIIa are themselves stabilized by their interaction with VIII, which links them with GOS and GON, respectively.VIII molecules outline the GON and help to stabilize hexons on the inside of the capsid.Protein VI also stabilizes hexon by binding the hexon trimer central cavity exposed to the inner viral lumen.The capsid surrounds and protects the viral core composed of the viral genome, the viral core proteins (i.e., V, VII, Mu in species C viruses), and the terminal protein (TP), which is covalently bound to each 5' end of the Ad genome.Minor capsid proteins interact with core proteins establishing a connection between capsid and genome; however, their spatial organization in relation to the core proteins remains poorly understood.It has been shown that V maintains DNA inside the capsid by interacting with VI (capsid side) and VII (genome side) and probably contributes to genome release at the nuclear pore.VII is the main capsid protein associated with viral DNA and promotes its condensation inside the capsid.VII also protects the viral genome from immune detection through cellular factors.Interestingly, capsid protein IX and protein V are only present in Mastadenoviridae, and viral capsids can be produced without IX or protein VII, showing some flexibility in the capsid structure.The genome of human Ads encodes ~45 proteins (including the structural proteins), organized into temporally regulated transcription units.The transcription factor E1A is the first expressed protein and is necessary to initiate viral gene expression.The genome also harbors a 5' encapsidation sequence and inverted terminal repeats (ITR) at each extremity which are required for replication.Adenoviruses encode an adenoviral protease (AVP) which is packed into the particle and processes several proteins (i.e., IIIa, VI, VII, VIII, micro, TP, and 52.55K in species C viruses)."
281,"The genome also harbors a 5' encapsidation sequence and inverted terminal repeats (ITR) at each extremity which are required for replication.Adenoviruses encode an adenoviral protease (AVP) which is packed into the particle and processes several proteins (i.e., IIIa, VI, VII, VIII, micro, TP, and 52.55K in species C viruses).This step is required for the formation of mature infectious particles and induces the formation of metastable (i.e., less stable) capsids primed for capsid disassembly upon cell attachment and entry.There are also species-specific differences in the structure of human Ads, e.g., in the fiber length and flexibility, which directly affects receptor binding.Differences can also be observed in penton assembly.Penton of species B viruses can form inter-penton contacts, resulting in alternative and less stable virus-like particles that are devoid of genomes and occasionally without fibers.Such particles are called dodecahedron and are studied for the cell transfer of plasmids or peptides as an alternative to Ad vectors.Dodecahedrons better expose a RGD short peptide motif present in penton of most Ad species, which is required to bind target cells.Differences in capsid stability, as discussed below, may be an important property that determines the entry fate of Ad particles.1.3.Adenoviruses Follow a Lytic Life CycleThe Ad infection cycle has been extensively reviewed elsewhere.Here, we briefly focus on the entry part of the life cycle, and, unless stated otherwise, we will refer to species C viruses, which are the best studied (Figure 1).Adenoviruses use the capsid fiber as the primary cell attachment molecule.Most Ads, including species C viruses, use the coxsackievirus and Ad receptor (CAR) to bind target cells.In contrast, some species B viruses preferentially bind the CD46 receptor or desmoglein 2, and some species D viruses were shown to interact with sialic acids or directly with alphavbeta integrins (see Table 1).Thus, fiber switching between species is an attractive strategy to change tropism.The primary role of the fiber molecule is to mediate the physical association with target cells, which is followed by a second interaction between penton and integrins, such as alphavbeta5.This interaction is mediated by the RGD peptide motif in the penton sequence.Absence of this motif, as in species F viruses, is associated with less efficient cell entry.Integrin binding results in integrin clustering at the cell surface that triggers a signaling cascade, leading to the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the endocytic uptake via clathrin-mediated endocytosis or micropinocytosis.RGD binding may also destabilize the capsid by decreasing contacts between penton and hexon, helping the capsid to uncoat.As a consequence, Ad particles lose their fiber, and one can find dissociated hexon and penton inside the endosome."
282,"RGD binding may also destabilize the capsid by decreasing contacts between penton and hexon, helping the capsid to uncoat.As a consequence, Ad particles lose their fiber, and one can find dissociated hexon and penton inside the endosome.The endosome is a dynamic organelle primed to mature into degradative lysosomes, and Ads have to escape rapidly into the cytosol.Endosome acidification may accelerate the escape process by further weakening the capsid.The endosome penetration process relies on the release of the internal capsid protein VI.The released VI is characterized by a N-terminal amphipathic helix that binds to the inner leaflet of the endosome and induces positive membrane curvature, resulting in locally confined membrane rupture.Cells respond to the virus-induced membrane rupture and activate a localized autophagy response to clear the damaged organelle.To avoid degradation, Ads stall autophagy via a short PPxY peptide motif in protein VI until the particle has reached the safety of the cytosol.Species C viruses were shown to escape from early endosomes.Other species including A, B, and D first traffic to the lysosome before escaping into the cytosol, which may affect the immune activation triggered by those viruses.Once Ads have reached the cytosol, they engage with dynein motors and use retrograde transport along microtubules to reach the microtubule organizing center.Motor binding is probably mediated by hexon and may require acidic priming.In the vicinity of the nucleus, capsids switch transport directionality, probably by binding to kinesin motor proteins, and accumulate at the nuclear envelope.They dock at the nuclear pore complex, then capsids are completely disassembled, and genomes are released and imported into the nucleus.Once inside the nucleus, the cycle continues by transcription activation of the genome and expression of the immediate early E1A gene, which serves as a transcription factor for all other early transcription units.Following expression of the replication enzymes, viral genomes are replicated and accumulate at the periphery of replication centers.Then, structural proteins are expressed from the late expression unit under the control of the major late promoter.Expression of late genes culminates in production and nuclear accumulation of all structural proteins where they assemble into progeny and package newly synthesized genomes.Nuclear assembly of the next generation of Ads then results in particle egress and cell lysis.As mentioned above, assembly of the capsids is followed by maturation, i.e., the proteolytic cleavage of several capsid proteins by the AVP to produce infectious particles.The importance of this process is exemplified by the temperature-sensitive mutant, Ts1, initially identified in a mutagenesis screen in Ad2.At the non-permissive temperature, this mutant fails to package the AVP, and assembled particles do not undergo maturation, resulting in hyperstable particles.The responsible AVP mutation was genetically introduced into Ad5 retaining this phenotype."
283,"At the non-permissive temperature, this mutant fails to package the AVP, and assembled particles do not undergo maturation, resulting in hyperstable particles.The responsible AVP mutation was genetically introduced into Ad5 retaining this phenotype.Ts1 capsids are still able to attach to cell receptors and to be endocytosed, but then remain trapped in the endosome due to their failure to liberate protein VI.2.Immune Detection of AdenovirusAdenoviruses are widespread, and a large majority of the population has been confronted with this virus, mainly during childhood.Adenoviruses are highly immunogenic, and every encounter provokes the development of specific anti-Ad immunity, both innate and adaptive, that can last a lifetime.This is important in the fight against the virus and renders Ads less harmful to the immune-competent host, but it can be an obstacle when Ads are to be used as a vector in vaccinology or gene therapy.Understanding how Ad (and its vector derivatives) activates the immune system will allow us to improve the effectiveness and safety of vaccines.Observations in vivo, from patients participating in clinical trials, clearly showed that Ad-based vectors have the ability to induce potent immune activation, sometimes with fatal consequences.In addition, various studies carried out in vitro or in animal models suggest a key role of the viral particle itself (i.e., capsid and incorporated DNA) in activating the initial immune response.Here, we briefly focus on immune responses associated with the entering capsid; for a more in-depth overview, see previously published reviews.2.1.Adenoviruses Trigger Cell Intrinsic ImmunityWith the development of Ads as vectors, it became apparent that cell intrinsic or innate immunity induced by Ads is a response to the invading virion.Interestingly, both replicative and non-replicative viruses (i.e., UV-inactivated virus, non-replicative vectors, or empty capsids) activate immune responses in the infected cells, showing that the capsid has a key role in this response.In general, Ads are sensed by cells at several steps throughout the entire viral life cycle and activate innate immunity pathways (Figure 1).This activation starts with the Ad fiber binding to the cell surface receptor CAR, which activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling that leads to the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB.This trigger results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8).However, depending on Ad species, other receptors usage may modulate the strength of the signaling cascade involved in cytokine expression.The interaction between viral penton and cellular integrin is a further trigger of immune activation.A study in murine macrophages showed that this binding activates the expression of IL-1alpha via the RGD motif."
284,"The interaction between viral penton and cellular integrin is a further trigger of immune activation.A study in murine macrophages showed that this binding activates the expression of IL-1alpha via the RGD motif.This might be restricted to immune cells because in other cell models (e.g., HeLa, epithelial cells line), the role of the integrin/RGD interaction in chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines production was not confirmed.This suggests a more important role of the internalization process itself in immune activation than the interaction with integrins.Indeed, penton binding to integrin also activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling to increase viral internalization.Moreover, PI3K activation has been shown upon Ad infection to trigger the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFalpha, and the internalization process has been described as required for immune activation.These studies suggest that immune activation mainly occurs at a post-internalization step, highlighting the importance of post-entry sorting (reviewed in).Once in the endosome, Ads are exposed to intraluminal pathogen-recognition receptors (PRR) such as TLR9, which is a double-stranded DNA sensor restricted to immune cells.Murine macrophages can sense Ad vectors via TLR9 to induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.TLR9 was also strictly required for IFNalpha/beta production when murine plasmacytoid dentritic cells (pDC) were challenged with Ad.However, in TLR9 knock-out mouse models, IFNalpha/beta was still produced, suggesting that, in cells other than pDC, IFN production occurs independently from TLR9 signaling.Viral genomes (or vector genomes) become accessible to sensing during or after the endosomal escape of the virus.Once they reach the cytosol, they are sensed by the cytosolic double-stranded DNA sensor cGAS.Upon viral genome recognition, cGAS promotes phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor IRF3 to drive IFNalpha/beta expression, inducing an antiviral state.Endosomal passage requires virus-induced endosomal membrane damage to facilitate endosomal escape of viral particles.Membrane rupture thus considerably contributes to immune activation, highlighted by the fact that the escape defective Ts1 mutant fails to activate a complete and efficient immune response.A pivotal role in the inflammatory response upon Ad membrane penetration is played by the tank-binding kinase, TBK1, suggested to be part of a down-stream cytosolic sensing of the viral genome via the cGAS/STING pathway.Adenovirus membrane damage also results in the release of cathepsin B from the endo-lysosomal compartment, causing oxidative stress, which activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in IL-1beta maturation.Species C viruses escape from early endosomes, while species B viruses traffic until late endosomes, presumably due to differences in receptor usage.Acidification in late endosome/lysosome is more likely to activate lysosomal acid hydrolases."
285,"Species C viruses escape from early endosomes, while species B viruses traffic until late endosomes, presumably due to differences in receptor usage.Acidification in late endosome/lysosome is more likely to activate lysosomal acid hydrolases.Both species induce inflammasome activation, but, probably owed to the residing time in the endosome, the extent of their responses differ.Globally, species B viruses induce a stronger innate and adaptive immune activation than species C viruses.This may explain why species B viruses are more pathogenic, causing outbreaks in immune competent hosts.It further suggests that cells are able to discriminate the penetration compartment (i.e., endosome vs. lysosome,) and adapt the efficiency of immunity.Endosomal membrane damage during the Ad escape process can also be a danger signal in itself.As discussed in detail below, membrane damage results in the cytosolic exposure of intraluminal glycans, which are detected by the cell as danger signals (as reviewed in).The detection of exposed glycans by galectins subsequently activates autophagy, triggering a second branch of antiviral immunity.2.2.Adenoviruses Provoke an Aadaptive Immune Response and Subvert Antiviral Autophagy upon Cell EntryInnate immune responses provoked by Ads or their vectors subsequently translates into adaptive immunity through chemokine secretion that attracts immune cells (neutrophils, natural killer cells, and macrophages) and reinforces potent antigen presentation.Adenoviruses are highly immunogenic, and their main immunogens are the major capsid proteins (hexon, penton, and fiber) that trigger the species-specific production of neutralizing antibodies by B cells.Neutralizing antibodies are mostly directed against the hyper-variable loops of the hexon protein and represent a major limitation for the use of Ads as vectors, if derived from the same serotype.This problem has been circumvented by the use of less seroprevalent or non-human Ads.Despite this anti-vector immunity, when Ads are used as vaccine platforms (e.g., to elicit immune protection against Ebola in clinical trials), they still induce a strong B cell response, allowing the production of antibodies against the desired vaccine immunogen that can last for up to 6 months.In addition, pre-existing vector immunity could be overcome with higher vaccine vector doses, as in the case of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine vector based on the highly seroprevalant AdC5.As with neutralizing antibodies, Ad infections trigger a persistent T-cell immunity, mainly through CD4+ activation.This protection can still be found in adults, suggesting a long-lasting immunity from childhood.In addition, activation of CD8+ is also described to maintain a cytotoxic response.This T-cell activation is not necessarily serotype-specific and allows cross-protection against different Ad subgroups and serotypes."
286,"In addition, activation of CD8+ is also described to maintain a cytotoxic response.This T-cell activation is not necessarily serotype-specific and allows cross-protection against different Ad subgroups and serotypes.Moreover, in stem-cell-transplanted patients infected by Ad, a strong activation of CD4+ and CD8+ has been described.This activation is directed against hexon peptides and leads to a clearance of Ad viremia, emphasizing the major role of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activation in immune protection.While this T-cell-based immunity is directed against the Ad particle, Ads also trigger strong cellular immunity based on the T-cell response against the vaccine antigen, which is an advantage for long-lasting immunity when using recombinant Ad vectors as vaccine platforms.Importantly, data from clinical trials have confirmed that when Ad is used as a vaccine platform (with the desired antigen as transgene), it induces both cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell and CD4+ T-cell activation, leading to memory immunity against the expressed transgene.T-cell activation relies on the presentation of viral peptides through the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).Briefly, antigen presentation by MHC class I results from proteasomal degradation, and the peptides obtained will induce CD8+ T-cell activation, allowing priming and proliferation of a cytotoxic T-cell response.MHC class II antigen presentation results from lysosomal proteolysis, and the resulting peptides will induce CD4+ T-cell activation upon presentation, triggering the subsequent activation of B cells.It is now well characterized that autophagy promotes peptide presentation to the MHC class II molecules.Not surprisingly, autophagy is one of the oldest defense mechanisms against infection and an important part of the cellular repertoire against invading pathogens, participating in both innate and adaptive immune responses.It can directly sequester a pathogen for degradation (xenophagy) and participates in their presentation to the immune system.Macroautophagy (more commonly called autophagy) is a conserved lysosomal degradation pathway that participates in many fundamental physiological processes such as homeostasis and innate and adaptive immunity.Autophagy is characterized by the formation of a double membrane vesicle called ""autophagosome"" that engulfs cytoplasmic cargoes (i.e., organelles, aggregates, and pathogens) destined for degradation (Figure 2).During this process, cargo-containing autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes in order to be degraded and recycled.Antigen presentation via autophagy has been described for both MHC class I and class II.After induction of autophagy, intracellular antigens are engulfed in autophagosomes, fusing with MHC class II containing compartments to provide them with external pathogen material (Figure 2).The role of autophagy in this particular MHC class II antigen presentation was first described for Epstein-Barr virus infection, where inhibition of autophagy led to decreased CD4+ T-cell activation."
287,"After induction of autophagy, intracellular antigens are engulfed in autophagosomes, fusing with MHC class II containing compartments to provide them with external pathogen material (Figure 2).The role of autophagy in this particular MHC class II antigen presentation was first described for Epstein-Barr virus infection, where inhibition of autophagy led to decreased CD4+ T-cell activation.To date, examples include several viruses including herpes simplex virus, influenza virus, and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and probably extends to Ads (see below).MHC class II presentation is consistent with the process of autophagy as it is a cytosolic defense mechanism.Autophagy is also involved in MHC class II cross-presentation of extracellular antigens.Indeed, the MHC presentation of extracellular ovalbumin is more efficient when the autophagy machinery (and especially ATG5) is functional, and the uptake of extracellular material was shown to involve a non-canonical form of autophagy called LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP).Once present in the LAP-osome, extracellular antigens can be exposed through MHC class II presentation.Autophagy is also involved to some degree in MHC class I presentation, although the vast majority of the epitopes are presented via a mechanism strictly dependent on the transporter associated with the antigen processing (TAP) complex.TAP-independent presentation mediated by autophagy was so far shown only under TAP depletion conditions.If this mode of presentation truly exists remains controversial and is discussed elsewhere.To prevent MHC presentations, Ads dedicate a great deal of their genome, namely the E3 region, to undermine the MHC presentation system in cells.In most (vaccine) vectors, these genes are absent, and recent work suggests that increasing antigen presentation by MHC could improve Ad vaccine efficiency.Autophagy plays a crucial role in processing Ad antigens for MHC class II presentation in Ad-induced immunity.Montespan et al.showed that Ads induce autophagy upon endosome penetration and that entering particles cleared by autophagy in this process are efficiently presented to the immune system.This observation is consistent with the study published by Klein et al.showing that in the context of oncolytic Ads, the viral antigens are matured by a JNK-dependent form of autophagy.However, autophagy in the context of cancer plays a dual role.As a homeostasis keeper, autophagy limits tumor initiation while in advanced cancer autophagy acts as a survival process to favor tumor growth.Thus, in the context of oncolytic vectors, tumor-specific autophagy features should be carefully evaluated.3.Adenoviruses as (Vaccine) VectorsVectorization of a virus involves the exploitation of its natural properties, while simultaneously minimizing the associated biological risk.In these terms, Ads are excellent vector candidates for vaccine development.Adenovirus vectors are stable, are easy to produce to a high titer, and have large cloning capacities.This allows insertion of a transgene, i.e., to express an antigen of choice."
288,"Adenovirus vectors are stable, are easy to produce to a high titer, and have large cloning capacities.This allows insertion of a transgene, i.e., to express an antigen of choice.They have a broad infectivity spectrum and transduce non-dividing cells, and their genome is non-integrative.As described above, they also provoke an inflammatory response in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that serves an adjuvant function to amplify the immune response necessary to vaccinate efficiently.Moreover, Ad-derived vectors have been extensively used in preclinical and clinical trials to prove their safety.To eliminate the unwanted part of the replication cycle, viral replication needs to be suppressed to prevent cell lysis and viral propagation.Adenovirus vector development started during the early 1990s as a platform for a large range of therapeutic approaches, such as gene therapy, oncolytic vectors, and vaccine development.Most of the early vector developments were modified versions of species C viruses.3.1.Adenovirus Vector Development, a Generational ApproachThe first generation of an Ad vector was made by deleting the E1 and E3 region from the viral genome, notably encoding the immediate early transcription factor, preventing these vectors from replicating.These vectors had a cloning capacity of around 8 kb to insert a transgene with regulatory sequences.The first-generation vectors were produced in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells stably transformed with a part of the Ad5 viral genome that complements the E1 region in trans.One of the major drawbacks of this system is that it allows the reconstitution of replication-competent genomes after spontaneous recombination.The additional deletion of E3, which is not necessary for vector production, increases the size of the transgene cassette, and promotes a better immune response.Unfortunately, first-generation Ad vectors were not completely transcriptionally inert and still elicited a strong immune response against viral capsid proteins that were expressed at baseline levels.This anti-vector immunity contributed to vector toxicity and short-term elimination of transduced cells.The second generation of Ad vectors additionally had the E2 and E4 regions removed from the vector genome.E2 encodes the replication enzymes and E4 additional regulatory proteins.This allowed space for 10.5 kb of transgene sequences, including up to four expression cassettes.Likewise, the supplemental deletions strongly reduced unwanted recombination and prolonged transgene expression.This was probably the result of a reduced aberrant viral gene expression that further reduces anti-vector immunity.Adenoviral vectors of the third generation are conceptually different.They consist of a packaged vector genome and a non-packaged viral genome (helper virus) that produces vector particles.Such vectors are also known as ""helper-dependent"", ""gutless"", or ""high-capacity"" (HC-Ad) vectors.They have the highest possible cloning capacity and can carry sequences of up to 36 kb."
289,"Such vectors are also known as ""helper-dependent"", ""gutless"", or ""high-capacity"" (HC-Ad) vectors.They have the highest possible cloning capacity and can carry sequences of up to 36 kb.High-capacity Ads lack any viral coding sequence except ITRs and a short encapsidation signal that permits genome packaging and which is absent from the helper virus.This strategy has allowed us to finally overcome most anti-vector immunity, permitting the long-term expression of transgenes.However, HC-Ads are not part of the current vaccine vector repertoire.3.2.Adenovirus as a Vaccine VectorBefore exploring how Ad vectors have been exploited, it is noteworthy to mention that vaccination against Ad species B viruses type 4 and type 7 themselves was developed in the early 1970s.This oral live vaccine is mandatory since 2011 for military recruits in the USA and dramatically decreased infection rates, reaching virtually zero.This highlighted the intrinsic efficiency and safety of Ad as a vaccine and opened the field to use Ad as a vaccination platform.To date, over 200 Ad-based vaccines entered clinical trials.Many of them are directed against infectious pathogens such as HIV-1 and Ebola.Adenovirus-based vaccines are not without drawbacks.A recently developed anti-HIV vaccine, based on the species C virus Ad5, used a mixture of vectors expressing the HIV-1 gag, pol, and nef genes.The vectors were safe, immunogenic, and well-tolerated.Unfortunately, the resulting STEP clinical trial had to be prematurely stopped.Not only has this vaccine been shown not to protect against HIV infection, but epidemiological data suggested that vaccination with Ad in this case increased the HIV infection risk.Having a pre-existing immunity against Ad5 was identified as a potential post-vaccination risk factor.However, this observation was not confirmed in similar studies and remains mechanistically unclear.Next to HIV, Ad-based vector vaccines have been developed in the fight against Ebola (Ad-EBOV), a recurrent threat in Western Africa.All Ad-EBOV vaccines use the Ebola glycoprotein (GP) as the vaccine antigen.Initial preclinical trials in rodents and primates used Ad5 and showed protection over 3 months with production of neutralizing antibodies and CD8+ activation.This vaccine went through phase II clinical trial; however, pre-existing immunity to Ad5 in the vaccinated population has led to variation in the level of elicited neutralizing antibodies.To overcome this issue, vaccines based on the less prevalent species D Ad26 have been developed.However, Ad26 is less immunogenic in humans, resulting in decreased vaccination efficiency, and required a prime boost using a measles virus-based vaccine (MVA).This vaccination regime has reached phase III clinical trials.Use of non-human Ad vectors has also been under development."
290,"This vaccination regime has reached phase III clinical trials.Use of non-human Ad vectors has also been under development.Use of chimpanzee ChAd3 as a vaccine platform against EBOV showed protection in rodents and in chimpanzees, and clinical trials employing those vectors are at different steps of progress.Until recently, HIV-1 and EBOV vaccines were the two main examples for the application of Ad vector-based vaccines, but they are not the only ones.Different attempts have been made to employ Ad vaccine vectors against various pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, dengue virus, hepatitis B and C, rabies, or influenza.However, their efficacy was always below expectations (for more details, see).The EBOV vaccine candidate has remained the only practically applied Ad vaccine and is used with some restrictions in the Democratic Republic of Congo.This vaccine is based on the Ad26 type (Ad26-ZEBOV/MVA-BN-FILO), and, as of May 2020, 20,339 people received the first dose of vaccination, and 9560 were fully vaccinated.Adenovirus-vectorized vaccines have received a major public boost in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.The urgency of the situation has made it possible to capitalize on their development, including experience gained with vaccines raised against coronaviruses that caused previous regionally confined SARS-CoV-1 outbreaks.The coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein was identified as the best vaccine antigen for immunity to coronavirus infections.To date, four Ad vector vaccines, all encoding the spike antigen, are in an advanced state and have been granted for emergency use in large parts of the world.The applied vector strategies have been slightly different, but essentially involve the use of first-generation vectors.They range from using species C Ad5-based vectors (Ad5-nCoV), overcoming pre-existing immunity with a high vector dose (CanSino), to the use of less prevalent species D virus Ad26, using a stabilized spike glycoprotein (JNJ-78436735/Ad26.COV2.S).An alternative approach uses ChAdOx1-S-(AZD1222), an Ad vector from chimpanzees.The only vaccine in use based on a heterologous prime-boost strategy to overcome vector immunity (Gam-COVID-Vac/Sputnik V) applies first an Ad26-based vector and then in the booster injection uses an Ad5 vector.In all cases, clinical trial data have been very promising, showing high levels of induced protective immunity, and emergency use has been granted in several countries for the use of Ad-based vaccines."
291,"The only vaccine in use based on a heterologous prime-boost strategy to overcome vector immunity (Gam-COVID-Vac/Sputnik V) applies first an Ad26-based vector and then in the booster injection uses an Ad5 vector.In all cases, clinical trial data have been very promising, showing high levels of induced protective immunity, and emergency use has been granted in several countries for the use of Ad-based vaccines.Furthermore, epidemiological surveys in the ongoing vaccination campaigns in different countries suggest an overwhelming success in the use of Ad-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.4.Modulating Adenovirus (Vaccine) Vector Efficacy, the Capsid Leads the WayAdenovirus (vaccine) vector design has to take into account a number of factors.These include maintaining a long and sustained expression of the encoded antigen and the activation of an immunological context (adjuvant effect) that permits efficient translation of the antigen expression into a persistent adaptive immunity directed against the immunogen but not against the vector itself.The immunological context is provided by the innate immune activation that the vaccine vector elicits during administration.In this context, the efficiency with which innate immune sensors detect the vector is important, and will in turn determine the amplitude of the adaptive response.As described in the sections above, innate immune sensing is mainly taking place at the post-entry level, concomitant with Ad endosome penetration.The efficient expression of the (vaccine) antigen depends then on the balance between the level of vector clearance vs. successful delivery and expression of vector genomes to the nucleus.With the development of capsid display vectors, expression of the transgene is not required to elicit immune activation.This strategy is based on the insertion of an epitope of interest into Ad capsid proteins, allowing its direct exposure to the immune system.Even if this approach has some advantages, most vaccine vectors rely on genetically encoded genes.For further reading on capsid display vectors, please see these reviews,.Pre-existing immunity against a viral vector (e.g., 30-90% against the species C virus Ad5, depending on the geographic location) can reduce vector uptake and decrease the antigen expression and the resulting immune response.Several strategies have been developed to decrease anti-vector immunity and have been recently reviewed.Briefly, the neutralizing antibodies mainly recognize the hypervariable loop of hexons and as a consequence are serotype-specific.These hypervariable loops can therefore be replaced by those of another, less prevalent serotype.This prevents the vector from being neutralized and inactivated.As Ad5 is the most seroprevalent type, using rare serotypes such as Ad26, Ad35, or non-human Ads would also avoid this issue.However, a major drawback with the use of rare types is their lower immunogenicity that makes them less efficient regarding vaccine development.Therefore, strategies to decrease anti-vector immunity should be developed in parallel to strategies to enhance vector immunogenicity in order to obtain the most efficient vector."
292,"However, a major drawback with the use of rare types is their lower immunogenicity that makes them less efficient regarding vaccine development.Therefore, strategies to decrease anti-vector immunity should be developed in parallel to strategies to enhance vector immunogenicity in order to obtain the most efficient vector.Even if the initial level of neutralizing antibodies against the vector is low, vaccination with a given vector type may trigger a response that prevents its future use.Priming of the anti-vector response also takes place at the post-entry level, when vector particles are sorted and processed as antigens themselves.Eliciting an immunologically favorable context for vaccination success may come at the expense of increased priming for vector immunity.Understanding the parameters that determine the fate of Ad vectors after uptake may provide an opportunity for vector design.4.1.Stability Lies in the SpeciesReceptor-mediated uptake and escape from the endo-lysosomal compartment are hallmarks of Ad infection and vector transduction.The initial uptake is determined by the interaction of the virus fiber and penton molecules with cell receptors.Fiber and penton are common to all Ads, but, according to their species, they engage with different cellular receptors (Table 1).Species C viruses use CAR, and entering particles escape from an early endosomal compartment.If species C viruses (Ad5) are engineered to contain a fiber molecule from a species B virus (Ad16), the resulting particle (Ad5F16) then escapes from a lysosomal compartment (as shown by costaining with the lysosomal marker LAMP1) instead of the early endosome.This delayed escape from lysosomes is a feature shared with all tested species B viruses.Furthermore, the hybrid Ad5F16 as well as species B viruses elicit a stronger pro-inflammatory response than species C viruses.This is attributed to increased detection via intraluminal TLR9 in immune cells.In addition, lysosomal membrane damage, unlike early endosome damage, causes strong oxidative stress.Lysosome rupture co-releases lysosomal hydrolases such as cathepsin B that can damage mitochondria, thus amplifying the damage response through inflammasome activation.The Ad uptake process destabilizes the capsid, allowing the release of the viral protein VI.Released protein VI then penetrates the membrane from within the endo-lysosomal compartment to allow the virus to gain access to the cytosol.Comparing species C and B shows that both viruses are equally efficient in cytosol entry and genome delivery, but differ in their escape kinetics.The fact that a simple fiber swap can transfer the entry and immunogenic properties from species B to a species C virus is remarkable.It provides a proof of concept that hybrid vectors with specific properties can be designed.The underlying difference seems to be that protein VI release is delayed in species B viruses (or the hybrid virus) and may require either acidification or another, unknown disassembly trigger."
293,"It provides a proof of concept that hybrid vectors with specific properties can be designed.The underlying difference seems to be that protein VI release is delayed in species B viruses (or the hybrid virus) and may require either acidification or another, unknown disassembly trigger.Since protein VI release is delayed in this case, this could reflect an increased capsid stability.Indeed, species C Ad5 viruses were shown to release the fiber molecule upon cell binding, a step assumed to weaken the capsid and prime the disassembly process for protein VI release.In this context, fiberless Ad5 were shown to be less stable than native particles.In contrast, non-matured, hyperstable Ts1 Ad2/5 do not release fiber or protein VI and are poor inducers of inflammation, since they are neither triggering TLR9 nor causing membrane damage.Whether fiber swapping with species B prevents initial fiber release and renders the species C capsid more stable has not been investigated but is probable.Capsid stability maybe an essential determinant of post-entry capsid fate and, by extension, a feature that could be exploited for vector design.Species B viruses may be more stable due to the use of a different receptor or through a unique fiber-penton interaction.In contrast, species F viruses Ad40/41 infect the gastrointestinal tract and have increased capsid stability due to their tropism and their adaptation to the harsh gut environment.The gut has an intrinsic temperature that is a few degrees above the upper respiratory tract targeted by species C viruses (37  C vs. 33  C).Thus, Ad40/41 are intrinsically more thermostable, supporting the infection process, making them also difficult to propagate.In addition, they lack a RGD motif in the penton molecule, resulting in a further reduced cell entry.Whether these unique capsid properties translate into escape from a lysosomal compartment or partial disassembly/protein VI release defects upon entry is not known.In contrast, these properties may provide a context for the development of oral vaccine applications.Unlike species B fibers, species F fiber-harboring vectors have a decreased immune activation when applied at standard environmental conditions.If a given human Ad species is now taken out of context and employed as a vaccine vector, it could be worthwhile to look at the natural tropism of this vector to look for clues as to predict its behavior.The currently used vaccine vector based on Ad26 is a species D virus, and its natural tropism is the eyes and the gastrointestinal tract.Species D viruses including Ad26 are less immunogenic than Ad5 and were shown to traffic to the late endosomal compartment, probably involving delayed protein VI release.Consequently, blocking acidification of the late endosomal compartment further reduced its immunogenicity.In contrast to human Ads, the knowledge on non-human Ads also used in vaccination and vectorization is very limited."
294,"Consequently, blocking acidification of the late endosomal compartment further reduced its immunogenicity.In contrast to human Ads, the knowledge on non-human Ads also used in vaccination and vectorization is very limited.Chimpanzee-derived Ads including the ChAd3 are closely related to species D viruses.Interestingly, Ad5 vectors are more immunogenic than chimpanzee-derived Ad vectors and have a higher transduction potential.This observation was not linked to differences in the penton RGD motif or the fiber, and its mechanistic reason remains unknown.Potential differences in capsid stability have not been investigated.Another non-human Ad exploited as a vector is the canine Ad type 2 (CAV-2).This vector has the remarkable property to transduce neurons selectively, but not surrounding glia cells, unlike an Ad5 control vector, despite both vectors using the same receptor.This ability may be linked to an increased capsid stability, allowing uncoating only in neuronal cells.Dogs have a body temperature that is ~2  C higher than humans, which potentially results in elevated CAV-2 capsid stability, analogous to the species F viruses.CAV-2 poorly elicits an innate immune response, consistent with a lack of efficient disassembly in target cells.Thus, CAV-2 vectors might be another example where a biophysical property linked to its natural tropism or host has the potential to provide novel vector properties.4.2.Fine-Tuning the Capsid Structure, the Example of Protein VI in Species C Ad2/5If capsid stability and protein VI release determine the downstream fate of the viral capsid, the question arises whether this can be modified in Ad vectors, i.e., to attribute novel properties to viral vectors (Figure 3).Most of our understanding of how Ads penetrate the endo-lysosomal compartment comes from the species C viruses Ad2/5.The discovery of protein VI as a membrane lytic factor was essential to understand this process.Protein VI encodes a N-terminal amphipathic helix that is the actual membrane lytic part of the protein.During virus production, protein VI is expressed as a precursor protein that associates with hexon trimers via the amphipathic helix.The complex is imported into the nucleus via transport signals encoded in the N- and C-terminus of protein VI, which are removed during virus assembly and maturation by the viral protease.The C-terminal 11 amino acid peptide also activates the protease, providing a smart way to link virus assembly with shielding of the amphipathic helix.The Ts1 Ad2/5 mutant virus has a packaging defect for the protease, and none of the capsid proteins, including protein VI, is processed.Resulting particles are hyperstable, retain fibers, and do not deploy protein VI.As consequence, Ts1 particles are sorted into lysosomes upon receptor-mediated endocytosis."
295,"Resulting particles are hyperstable, retain fibers, and do not deploy protein VI.As consequence, Ts1 particles are sorted into lysosomes upon receptor-mediated endocytosis.The exact location of protein VI in the mature virus is not clear, but the cleaved N-terminus localizes to the inner hexon surface of peripentonal hexons.Two point mutations in protein VI, G33A and S28C, were shown to increase the Ad5 capsid stability (Figure 3A).The first mutant precedes the N-terminal protease cleavage site in protein VI and impairs the processing.Resulting particles are partially immature and are characterized by an endosome lysis defect, suggesting that the N-terminus of protein VI stabilizes intra-virion protein-protein interactions.The second mutant was chosen for its ability to form intra-molecular disulfide bridges.The virus contained partially unprocessed proteins, potentially including protein VII, but surprisingly did not show any infectivity defects, despite its increased stability.Whether either of the viruses has an altered immune activation profile is not known.Another point mutation in protein VI that affects the virus fate is the protein VI L40Q mutation, directly situated in the amphipathic helix (Figure 3A).Viruses with this mutation mature normally but are partially defective for the endosome lysis step.In contrast to the above mentioned mutants, L40Q virions are less stable than their wild type counterparts.Instead of a delay, protein VI as well as penton are released prematurely from the L40Q capsid.L40Q virions are less infectious and subject to partial lysosome sorting.However, the L40Q mutation does not completely abolish the membrane lysis, and some viruses escape to the cytosol, resulting in an overall ~four-fold reduced infectivity of a L40Q vector.The observations suggest that the amphipathic helix contributes with its interaction to the particle stability.It is not known if and how the L40Q mutation alters the immunogenic property of Ad5 vectors.Recent observations suggest that release of protein VI from the capsid is triggered by internal competition with protein VII for the same or overlapping binding sites in hexons.Consistently, a mutant virus devoid of protein VII fails to escape from the endosome and has a defect in endosome lysis.Further understanding the structural and dynamic organization of the internal capsid (i.e., protein VI) and core proteins (i.e., protein V and VII) in the particle and during cell entry will greatly help to understand what determines (reversible) capsid stability.Controlling the efficiency of immune activation of Ad vectors is a major interest for the development of vaccines, and expanding MHC presentation of antigens would improve vaccine development.As mentioned previously, autophagy regulates immune activation and feeds peptides to the MHC."
296,"Further understanding the structural and dynamic organization of the internal capsid (i.e., protein VI) and core proteins (i.e., protein V and VII) in the particle and during cell entry will greatly help to understand what determines (reversible) capsid stability.Controlling the efficiency of immune activation of Ad vectors is a major interest for the development of vaccines, and expanding MHC presentation of antigens would improve vaccine development.As mentioned previously, autophagy regulates immune activation and feeds peptides to the MHC.Autophagy is one of the oldest cellular defense mechanisms against infection, yet Ads, as adapted human pathogens, have not evolved mechanisms to avoid autophagy upon entry.Instead, they seem to embrace autophagy activation and to divert the response to promote infection.Protein VI plays a central role in controlling the autophagy response of the cell.Adenovirus membrane lysis by protein VI leads to the recruitment of galectin 3 and galectin 8, which are recognized by the cell as danger signals (Figure 3B).Detection of Ad penetration sites by galectins activates selective autophagy in the infected cell, as illustrated by the recruitment of autophagy receptor (e.g., NDP52 andp62) and LC3 punctae formation.Interestingly, Ad5 vector particles manage to escape from the ruptured endosome and are able to traffic to the nucleus.Inhibiting autophagy does not affect viral infectivity, but delays their genome delivery to the nucleus, showing that Ads hijack the cellular machinery for their own profit.Escape from the endosome therefore allows the virus to avoid degradation by autophagy via an active process.This process was discovered by yet another protein VI mutant, the M1 mutant.All human Ads (and several non-human Ads) encode a highly conserved PPxY peptide motif in protein VI.In the M1 mutant, this motif was changed to PGAA (Figure 3).Both wild type and the M1 mutant efficiently release protein VI upon entry and trigger autophagy after rupture of the endosomal membrane.However, the M1 mutant virus is unable to escape efficiently into the cytosol, and EM images have shown that M1 mutant viruses are trapped in ruptured endosomes, targeted by autophagy.Consequently, the M1 mutant virus was shown to have a strong infectivity defect, which is restored upon the pharmacological and genetic inhibition of autophagy.The study showed that wild type viruses use their PPxY motif to recruit the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4.2 and limit the maturation of autophagosomes long enough to escape to the cytosol.Furthermore, this property allows the virus to limit its antigenic presentation.Importantly, the M1 mutant vector injected into mice resulted in much stronger anti-vector immunity and a reduced CD8+ response to the encoded transgene, showing that a simple capsid alteration can have a profound impact on the immunogenicity of the Ad5 capsid.Whether any of the other protein VI mutations affects immunogenicity is not known.However, the presence of the PPxY motif in the L40Q virus may explain why the vector retains a relatively high infectivity despite the membrane lysis defect."
297,"Whether any of the other protein VI mutations affects immunogenicity is not known.However, the presence of the PPxY motif in the L40Q virus may explain why the vector retains a relatively high infectivity despite the membrane lysis defect.Because the endosome lysis is less efficient, and L40Q vectors end up in part in the lysosomal compartment, it is conceivable that the elicited immune response is yet different from either wild type, Ts1, or M1 Ad5 capsids.5.ConclusionsAs demonstrated in this review, development of Ad-based (vaccine) vectors with specific and desired properties is in part driven by a comparison between available Ad species without necessarily understanding the mechanistics behind existing differences.The lack of data concerning the underlying biology for most vectors, other than species C, means that relying on rare or non-human serotypes bears a risk of missing out on properties or overlooking problems that can arise.We strongly advocate to ameliorate this lack of knowledge by pairing vector development and application with investigating the underlying vector and virus biology.In the meantime, we believe that the existing knowledge base on Ad biology, especially for species C viruses, could help with the design of new Ad vectors, including rare or non-human species, using rational design.In this review, we highlighted the link between Ad post-entry sorting and the ensuing innate immune response and provided examples of how Ad post-entry sorting differs between species and has been modulated.The non-exhaustive list of possible capsid modifications exemplified on capsid protein VI and restricted to Ad2/5 shows the great potential that still lies buried in the Ad capsid, waiting to be exploited.Lysosomal membrane damage, such as early endosomal membrane damage, also triggers autophagy, but in addition results in oxidative stress that alters the innate immune response of the cell.Altering the endo-lysosomal escape process of a species B, species D, or non-human Ad by introducing desirable mutations into the respective protein VI gene is only one of the possible options that come to mind.Other capsid proteins may hold additional functions related to transport or immune modulation.Extending rational capsid modifications to last-generation HC-Ad vectors and optimized antigen expression cassettes hold great promise for the next generation of Ad-based vaccine vectors.Publisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Author ContributionsC.F.D., N.P.and H.W.wrote, reviewed, and edited the paper.C.F.D.and N.P.contributed equally to this manuscript.All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.FundingC.F.D."

escapeLysosomal membrane permeabilization and cell deathAdenovirus cycle and associated immune response.Along its journey to the nucleus, Ad faces several cellular immune restrictions.Interaction of fiber and penton are required for initial attachment of Ad to cellular receptors; this interaction also induces a signaling cascade leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.Following entry, Ad is trapped inside an endosome where viral genomes can be detected via TLR9.The membrane lytic function of the viral protein VI allows viral penetration of the endosomal membrane, permitting viral escape into the cytosol.Endosomal escape occurs from within early or late endosome, depending on the Ad species.Membrane penetration of the viral capsid allows exposure of viral DNA in the cytosol that can be sensed by cGAS/STING.Membrane damage is also detected as a danger signal and induces both inflammasome and autophagy activation.MHC class II presentation by autophagy.Autophagy starts with the formation of a double membrane structure called phagophore that will elongate around the cargo to form a double-membrane vesicle called autophagosome.After fusion with lysosome, the cargo will be degraded in a so-called autolysosome.Further fusion of this vesicle with MHC class II compartment allows the loading of peptides for the ensuing MHC class II antigen presentation.Protein VI, a multifunctional viral protein determining the post-entry fate of the particle.(A) Domain organization of the membrane lytic protein VI.Protein VI is produced as a precursor form (pre_VI) and processed by the viral protease (AVP) at two sites.A role for the N-terminal part in capsid stability has been shown by two-point mutation (S28C and G33A).An amphipathic helix is responsible for the membrane lytic activity of protein VI, and a point mutation in this domain (L40Q) reduces the lytic activity.Protein VI encodes a conserved PPxY motif required for viral control of the cellular autophagy response against membrane penetration.Mutating the motif (PGAA) reduces viral infectivity.(B) Adenovirus membrane penetration via protein VI is recognized by the cell through glycan binding galectin 8 followed by autophagy induction.WT virus uses the PPxY motif in protein VI to recruit the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4.2 to suppress or halt autophagy until endosomal escape is completed.A
