65,65,"Impact and effectiveness of mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations, and deaths following a nationwide vaccination campaign in Israel: an observational study using national surveillance dataBackgroundFollowing the emergency use authorisation of the Pfizer–BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 (international non-proprietary name tozinameran) in Israel, the Ministry of Health (MoH) launched a campaign to immunise the 6·5 million residents of Israel aged 16 years and older.We estimated the real-world effectiveness of two doses of BNT162b2 against a range of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes and to evaluate the nationwide public-health impact following the widespread introduction of the vaccine.MethodsWe used national surveillance data from the first 4 months of the nationwide vaccination campaign to ascertain incident cases of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and outcomes, as well as vaccine uptake in residents of Israel aged 16 years and older.Vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 outcomes (asymptomatic infection, symptomatic infection, and COVID-19-related hospitalisation, severe or critical hospitalisation, and death) was calculated on the basis of incidence rates in fully vaccinated individuals (defined as those for whom 7 days had passed since receiving the second dose of vaccine) compared with rates in unvaccinated individuals (who had not received any doses of the vaccine), with use of a negative binomial regression model adjusted for age group (16–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65–74, 75–84, and ≥85 years), sex, and calendar week.The proportion of spike gene target failures on PCR test among a nationwide convenience-sample of SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens was used to estimate the prevelance of the B.1.1.7 variant.FindingsDuring the analysis period (Jan 24 to April 3, 2021), there were 232 268 SARS-CoV-2 infections, 7694 COVID-19 hospitalisations, 4481 severe or critical COVID-19 hospitalisations, and 1113 COVID-19 deaths in people aged 16 years or older.By April 3, 2021, 4 714 932 (72·1%) of 6 538 911 people aged 16 years and older were fully vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2.",0,1

70,70,"When seeking testing, individuals provide their identification number and a specimen is collected via nasal or nasopharyngeal swab.Specimens are tested, using national testing standards, at one of 48 clinical diagnostic laboratories with use of real-time PCR tests.B.1.1.7 prevalence was estimated on the basis of swabs tested at Leumit with the TaqPath COVID-19 test (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pleasanton, CA, USA), which identifies spike gene target failure (SGTF) associated with gene mutations that cause deletions of amino acids 69 and 70 in the spike protein.Because these mutations are found in B.1.1.7, SGTF is used to estimate the prevalence of this variant.Public health surveillanceMoH conducts surveillance for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, with mandatory daily reporting of PCR results by all diagnostic laboratories.An epidemiological investigation, including an interview about COVID-19 symptoms, is done for each SARS-CoV-2 infection, usually within 2 days of diagnosis.MoH also conducts surveillance of COVID-19-associated hospitalisations.Daily updates are received from all hospitals and linked to the national database using patients' identification numbers.Hospitalisations are classified as severe (if a patient has a resting respiratory rate of >30 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation on room air of <94%, or a ratio of PaO2 to FiO2 of <300) or critical (in the event of mechanical ventilation, shock, or cardiac, hepatic, or renal failure).In accordance with national guidelines, health-care providers attributed any hospitalisations and deaths among individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection to COVID-19.OutcomesVaccine effectiveness estimates were assessed against six SARS-CoV-2 outcomes, comprising asymptomatic infections and five other hierarchical laboratory-confirmed outcomes: all SARS-CoV-2 infections (symptomatic and asymptomatic), symptomatic COVID-19 cases, and COVID-19-related hospitalisations, severe or critical hospitalisations (including those who died), and deaths.Asymptomatic infection was defined as a person with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who reported no fever and no respiratory symptoms during the symptom interview portion of the epidemiological investigation, and who was not subsequently hospitalised for or did not die from COVID-19.Statistical analysisIndividuals were defined as unvaccinated if they had not received any doses of BNT162b2, and as fully vaccinated if at least 7 days had passed since receiving the second dose of BNT162b2.Incidence rates were calculated for unvaccinated and fully vaccinated individuals aged 16 years and older for each SARS-CoV-2 outcome after excluding people with previous laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.",0,6
