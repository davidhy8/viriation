0,0,"Recurrent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 spike deletion H69/V70 and its role in the Alpha variant B.1.1.7SummaryWe report severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike ΔH69/V70 in multiple independent lineages, often occurring after acquisition of receptor binding motif replacements such as N439K and Y453F, known to increase binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor and confer antibody escape.In vitro, we show that, although ΔH69/V70 itself is not an antibody evasion mechanism, it increases infectivity associated with enhanced incorporation of cleaved spike into virions.ΔH69/V70 is able to partially rescue infectivity of spike proteins that have acquired N439K and Y453F escape mutations by increased spike incorporation.In addition, replacement of the H69 and V70 residues in the Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike (where ΔH69/V70 occurs naturally) impairs spike incorporation and entry efficiency of the B.1.1.7 spike pseudotyped virus.Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster kinetics of cell-cell fusion than wild-type Wuhan-1 D614G, dependent on ΔH69/V70.Therefore, as ΔH69/V70 compensates for immune escape mutations that impair infectivity, continued surveillance for deletions with functional effects is warranted.Graphical abstractHighlightsSpike ΔH69/V70 does not confer escape from antibodiesSpike ΔH69/V70 increases cleaved S2 and spike infectivityB.1.1.7 requires ΔH69/V70 for efficient cleaved spike incorporation and infectivityB.1.1.7 spike requires ΔH69/V70 for rapid syncytium formationMeng et al.report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike ΔH69/V70 has arisen multiple times.The deletion increases entry efficiency associated with increased cleaved spike in virions and can compensate for loss of infectivity.The B.1.1.7 spike requires ΔH69/V70 for efficient cell entry and cell-cell fusion activity.IntroductionSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike surface glycoprotein engagement of human angiotensin-converting enzyme (hACE2) is essential for virus entry and infection, and the receptor is found in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.",1,0
1,1,"The deletion increases entry efficiency associated with increased cleaved spike in virions and can compensate for loss of infectivity.The B.1.1.7 spike requires ΔH69/V70 for efficient cell entry and cell-cell fusion activity.IntroductionSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike surface glycoprotein engagement of human angiotensin-converting enzyme (hACE2) is essential for virus entry and infection, and the receptor is found in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.Despite this critical interaction and the imposed constraints, it appears that the receptor binding domain (RBD) is relatively tolerant to mutations, raising the real possibility of virus escape from past infection or vaccine-induced immunity and monoclonal antibody treatments.Spike mutants exhibiting reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies have been identified in in vitro screens, and some of these mutations have been found in clinical isolates.Studying chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection can give insights into virus evolution that would require many chains of acute transmission to generate.This is because the majority of infections arise as a result of early transmission during pre- or asymptomatic phases prior to peak adaptive responses, and virus adaptation is not observed because the virus is usually cleared by the immune response.We recently documented de novo emergence of antibody evasion mutations mediated by spike gene mutations in an individual treated with convalescent plasma (CP).In addition, a chronically infected immune-suppressed individual has been reported recently in Russia with emergence of Y453F along with ΔH69/V70.Deletions in other parts of the N-terminal domain (NTD) have been reported to arise in chronic infection and reduce sensitivity to NTD-specific neutralizing antibodies.Here we analyze global SARS-CoV-2 data and find that ΔH69/V70 occurs independently, often emerging after a significant RBD amino acid replacement, such as Y453F and N439K, which are known to facilitate neutralizing antibody escape or alter ACE2 binding while incurring an infectivity defect, according to some reports.Although structural modeling indicates that H69/V70 is in an exposed loop that contracts after deletion, potentially altering an antigenic site, we report that the ΔH69/V70 does not confer significantly reduced susceptibility to convalescent sera or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).Functionally, we find that ΔH69/V70 does increase spike infectivity and compensates for an infectivity defect resulting from the RBD replacements N439K and Y453F.The infectivity increase is driven by higher levels of spike incorporation into virions.We demonstrate that the deletion is required for optimal infectivity of the 501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7) spike protein.We show that, although B.1.1.7 and the wild-type (WT) spike pseudotyped virus (PV) have similar infectivity on a range of target cell types, the B.1.1.7 spike protein alone induces more rapid cell-cell fusion and formation of multinucleated cells.",1,1

To explore whether D614G was required for this enhanced spike cleavage and infectivity, we generated PVs bearing D614 spike with and without ΔH69/V70, followed by infection of HEK293T cells.We observed a similar 2-fold enhancement of infection and a proportional increase in spike incorporation as we did for D614G spike PVs (Figures S1A and S1B).Finally, to exclude the possibility that increased incorporation of S was specific for pseudotyped lentiviral particles, we generated coronavirus-like particles by co-transfection of WT or ΔH69/V70 S with SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, as described previously.Compared with levels of N, levels of cleaved S in coronavirus-like particles were again enhanced in the presence of the ΔH69/V70 (Figures S1C and S1D).Enhanced infectivity of ΔH69/V70 spike is not correlated with cleavage or entry routeThe route of SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated virus entry in cell lines is not altered by ΔH69/V70 spike(A) Schematic illustrating spike in producer cells with CMK targeting and blocking furin cleavage (left panel).In target cells, camostat inhibits TMPRSS2 and, therefore, cell fusion at the plasma membrane, and E64D blocks cathepsins and targets endocytic viral entry (right panel).(B) Western blots show that CMK inhibits spike S1/S2 cleavage in producer cells transfected with the S ΔH69/V70 plasmid, and spikes with altered S1/S2 cleavage are incorporated into the virions.Antibodies against HIV-1 p24 and spike S2 were used with anti-GAPDH as a loading control.(C) The viruses produced from transfected HEK293T cells in the presence of CMK were used to transduce target cells.The luciferase reading is used as a surrogate for the spike infectivity bearing with various S2/FL ratios.The data shown are technical triplicates or quadruplicates, and statical analysis was done using an unpaired t test.(D) Comparison of the infectivity of spike with the PBCS deleted (ΔPBCS) with and without ΔH69/V70.The effect of ΔH69/V70 is independent of the PBCS.(E) ΔH69/V70 does not alter the virus entry route.S pseudotyped lentiviruses bearing WT S, ΔH69/V70 S, or VSV-G were used to transduce 293T-ACE2 or 293T-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells in the presence of E64D or camostat at different drug concentrations.",1,7
