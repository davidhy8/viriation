0,0,0,"Recurrent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 spike deletion H69/V70 and its role in the Alpha variant B.1.1.7SummaryWe report severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike ΔH69/V70 in multiple independent lineages, often occurring after acquisition of receptor binding motif replacements such as N439K and Y453F, known to increase binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor and confer antibody escape.In vitro, we show that, although ΔH69/V70 itself is not an antibody evasion mechanism, it increases infectivity associated with enhanced incorporation of cleaved spike into virions.ΔH69/V70 is able to partially rescue infectivity of spike proteins that have acquired N439K and Y453F escape mutations by increased spike incorporation.In addition, replacement of the H69 and V70 residues in the Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike (where ΔH69/V70 occurs naturally) impairs spike incorporation and entry efficiency of the B.1.1.7 spike pseudotyped virus.Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster kinetics of cell-cell fusion than wild-type Wuhan-1 D614G, dependent on ΔH69/V70.Therefore, as ΔH69/V70 compensates for immune escape mutations that impair infectivity, continued surveillance for deletions with functional effects is warranted.Graphical abstractHighlightsSpike ΔH69/V70 does not confer escape from antibodiesSpike ΔH69/V70 increases cleaved S2 and spike infectivityB.1.1.7 requires ΔH69/V70 for efficient cleaved spike incorporation and infectivityB.1.1.7 spike requires ΔH69/V70 for rapid syncytium formationMeng et al.report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike ΔH69/V70 has arisen multiple times.The deletion increases entry efficiency associated with increased cleaved spike in virions and can compensate for loss of infectivity.The B.1.1.7 spike requires ΔH69/V70 for efficient cell entry and cell-cell fusion activity.IntroductionSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike surface glycoprotein engagement of human angiotensin-converting enzyme (hACE2) is essential for virus entry and infection, and the receptor is found in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.",1,1
1,1,1,"The deletion increases entry efficiency associated with increased cleaved spike in virions and can compensate for loss of infectivity.The B.1.1.7 spike requires ΔH69/V70 for efficient cell entry and cell-cell fusion activity.IntroductionSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike surface glycoprotein engagement of human angiotensin-converting enzyme (hACE2) is essential for virus entry and infection, and the receptor is found in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.Despite this critical interaction and the imposed constraints, it appears that the receptor binding domain (RBD) is relatively tolerant to mutations, raising the real possibility of virus escape from past infection or vaccine-induced immunity and monoclonal antibody treatments.Spike mutants exhibiting reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies have been identified in in vitro screens, and some of these mutations have been found in clinical isolates.Studying chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection can give insights into virus evolution that would require many chains of acute transmission to generate.This is because the majority of infections arise as a result of early transmission during pre- or asymptomatic phases prior to peak adaptive responses, and virus adaptation is not observed because the virus is usually cleared by the immune response.We recently documented de novo emergence of antibody evasion mutations mediated by spike gene mutations in an individual treated with convalescent plasma (CP).In addition, a chronically infected immune-suppressed individual has been reported recently in Russia with emergence of Y453F along with ΔH69/V70.Deletions in other parts of the N-terminal domain (NTD) have been reported to arise in chronic infection and reduce sensitivity to NTD-specific neutralizing antibodies.Here we analyze global SARS-CoV-2 data and find that ΔH69/V70 occurs independently, often emerging after a significant RBD amino acid replacement, such as Y453F and N439K, which are known to facilitate neutralizing antibody escape or alter ACE2 binding while incurring an infectivity defect, according to some reports.Although structural modeling indicates that H69/V70 is in an exposed loop that contracts after deletion, potentially altering an antigenic site, we report that the ΔH69/V70 does not confer significantly reduced susceptibility to convalescent sera or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).Functionally, we find that ΔH69/V70 does increase spike infectivity and compensates for an infectivity defect resulting from the RBD replacements N439K and Y453F.The infectivity increase is driven by higher levels of spike incorporation into virions.We demonstrate that the deletion is required for optimal infectivity of the 501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7) spike protein.We show that, although B.1.1.7 and the wild-type (WT) spike pseudotyped virus (PV) have similar infectivity on a range of target cell types, the B.1.1.7 spike protein alone induces more rapid cell-cell fusion and formation of multinucleated cells.",1,1

B.1.1.7 appeared to mediate more cell-cell fusion events over earlier time points, with the color overlap area being 2–3 times greater for B.1.1.7 compared with the WT 6 h after mixing.Interestingly, this enhancement was abrogated by re-insertion of the H69 and V70 residues (Figures 7B–7D).We conclude that B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster fusion kinetics than the WT bearing D614G Wuhan-1 spike that is dependent on ΔH69/V70.ΔH69/V70 does not enhance infectivity of bat coronavirus RaTG13 spikeFinally, to investigate the importance of this part of spike beyond SARS-CoV-2 for other coronaviruses with zoonotic potential, we examined the 69/70 region of spike in a set of other known sarbecoviruses (Figures S4A–S4C).",1,1

5,16,16,"This independent occurrence of the insertion is suggestive of context-dependent selective pressure playing a role in recurring gain and loss of these two residues in sarbecoviruses.To test whether the fitness effect associated with acquisition of ΔH69/V70 is specific to SARS-CoV-2 and not other sarbecovirus spike backgrounds, we cloned FL S from RaTG13 and generated pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing RaTG13 spike protein as well as a RaTG13 S ΔH69/V70 counterpart.We observed that cleaved and uncleaved S expression levels in the PV did not differ between WT and the ΔH69/V70 RaTG13 spike and that there was no difference in infectivity on target cells expressing ACE2 or ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Figures S4D and S4E).This result suggests that, as one would expect, the enhancing effect of ΔH69/V70 on spike levels and infectivity is specific to the spike background.DiscussionWe have presented data demonstrating multiple independent and circulating lineages of SARS-CoV-2 variants bearing spike ΔH69/V70.This recurring deletion, spanning 6 nt, is due to an out-of-frame deletion of 6 nt and occurs in the terminal loop of a helix loop motif within the predicted RNA structure, as do other NTD deletions observed in new variants, such as B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617 (Delta), B.1.351 (Beta), and P.1 (Gamma) (Figure S5).Stable helix loop motifs are associated with pausing/dissociation events in reverse transcriptase.Because all nucleic acid polymerases have a common ancestor with homologous dinucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) binding motifs and similar global structures, it is probable that all RNA polymerases use similar mechanisms for transcript termination.A recent in-cell biochemical analysis of SARS-CoV2 RNA structure showed nucleotide reactivity consistent with this model within these stem-loops.These analyses provide a rationale for preferential emergence of ΔH69/V70 and other deletions, such as the well-described NTD antibody escape deletion ΔY144 (in B.1.1.7 and the recently reported B.1.525) at the terminal loops of helical loop motifs.ΔH69/V70 itself has frequently followed immune escape-associated amino acid replacements in the RBD (e.g., N439K and Y453F) and is specifically found in the B.1.1.7 variant, known to have higher transmissibility and, possibly, pathogenicity.We find that ΔH69/V70 does not significantly reduce the sensitivity of spike to neutralizing antibodies in serum from a group of recovered individuals or binding of multiple mAbs directed against the NTD.In addition, we have shown that repair of ΔH69/V70 does not appreciably alter the potency of NTD antibodies against the B.1.1.7 spike.Thus, the deletion is unlikely to be an immune escape mechanism.",1,1
6,17,17,"In addition, we have shown that repair of ΔH69/V70 does not appreciably alter the potency of NTD antibodies against the B.1.1.7 spike.Thus, the deletion is unlikely to be an immune escape mechanism.Instead, our experimental results demonstrate that ΔH69/V70 is able increase infectivity of the Wuhan-1 D614G spike PV as well as the PV bearing the additional RBD mutations N439K or Y453F, explaining why the deletion is often observed after these immune escape mutations that carry infectivity cost.We show that the mechanism of enhanced infectivity across the RBD mutations tested is associated with greater spike incorporation into virions where ΔH69/V70 is present.The phenotype is also independent of producer cells used.Importantly, we were able to recapitulate the ΔH69/V70 phenotype in a spike protein that did not have the D614G mutation, indicating that D614G is not involved in the mechanism.These observations are supported by ΔH69/V70 being observed in D614 viruses in January 2020 in the United States and Thailand.Although we did not use a replication-competent system, a recent study reports that the ΔH69/V70 mutated Washington strain virus isolate confers increased replication in cell lines and higher viral loads in hamsters.Indeed, ΔH69 has been observed in cell culture during remdesivir selection experiments with a replication-competent virus, consistent with a replication advantage.We have found consistent differences in spike as well as cleaved spike in the producer cell and its incorporation into PV particles when comparing ΔH69/V70 with a Wuhan-1 spike (both with D614G).This could be explained by stability during intracellular trafficking or the route taken to the surface, differences in post-translational modification of the spike protein, or membrane characteristics at the budding site of virus or virus-like particles.Because the amount of spike incorporation into virions reflects the spike in the cells, virion formation is likely unaffected by ΔH69/V70.Interestingly, although pharmacological inhibition of furin by CMK in producer cells did prevent S1/S2 cleavage and altered the balance of S2:FL spike in cells and virions, PV infectivity was not reduced by drug treatment.These data suggest that the increase in entry efficiency conferred by spike ΔH69/V70 is independent of spike S1/S2 cleavage.Similar findings regarding the lack of relationship between the balance of S2:FL and infectivity have been reported in the context of furin knockout cells rather than furin inhibition with CMK.In addition, a recent report on the S1/S2 cleavage site mutation P681H demonstrated that enhanced cleavage of spike P681H was not associated with increased PV infectivity or cell fusion relative to the WT.",1,1
7,18,18,"Similar findings regarding the lack of relationship between the balance of S2:FL and infectivity have been reported in the context of furin knockout cells rather than furin inhibition with CMK.In addition, a recent report on the S1/S2 cleavage site mutation P681H demonstrated that enhanced cleavage of spike P681H was not associated with increased PV infectivity or cell fusion relative to the WT.There may, however, be differences in vivo.We explored the entry route of ΔH69/V70 spike using cathepsin inhibition to block endosomal entry and camostat to block entry via plasma membrane fusion.ΔH69/V70 spike was as sensitive to camostat and the cathepsin inhibitor ED64 as the WT, arguing that the efficiency of entry route is similar despite differences in cleaved spike.Although S1/S2 cleavage allows avoidance of endosome-associated IFITM restriction and appears to be critical for transmission in animal models, cleaved spike may be less infectious when S1 is shed prematurely, possibly conferring a disadvantage under some circumstances.In addition, showed that S1/S2 cleavage in the producer cell, conferred by a polybasic stretch at the cleavage site, is advantageous in cells expressing abundant TMPRSS2 but deleterious in cells lacking TMPRSS2.The Alpha variant Al (B.1.1.7), bearing seven spike mutations, is responsible for a new pandemic phase that is demonstrably more pathogenic and more transmissible.Detection of a high number of novel mutations suggests that this lineage has been introduced from a geographic region with very poor sampling or that viral evolution may have occurred in a single individual in the context of chronic infection.We show that Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike has similar infectivity as WT D614G spike, consistent with data on live B.1.1.7 virus in human airway epithelial cells but in contrast to another study that showed a difference in live virus with the 8 spike mutations.Importantly, however, we demonstrate loss of infectivity when the H69/V70 amino acids are replaced in B.1.1.7 S, accompanied, as expected, by reduced S1/S2 cleavage and reduced S incorporation into virions.These data point to epistatic interactions between observed mutations in spike of B.1.1.7 with a trade-off between mutations that incur virus entry cost with those that contribute to other activities, such as immune evasion.Of greatest potential importance is our observation that Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster syncytium formation and that this enhanced cell-cell fusion activity is dependent on ΔH69/V70.Syncytium formation is a key feature of severe and fatal COVID-19 and implicated in elevated viral replication.",1,1

Pseudovirus with serial dilution of mAbs was incubated for 1 h at 37°C and then added to the wells after washing 2 times with DMEM.After 2–3 h DMEM containing 20% FBS and 2% penicillin–streptomycin was added to the cells.Following 48-72 h of infection, Bio-Glo (Promega) was added to the cells and incubated in the dark for 15 min before reading luminescence with Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek).Measurements were done in duplicate and relative luciferase units were converted to percent neutralization and plotted with a non-linear regression model to determine IC50 values using GraphPad PRISM software (version 9.0.0).Neutralization assaysMeasurements were done in duplicate and relative luciferase units were converted to percent neutralization against no-drug control which was set as 100%.Data were plotted with a non-linear regression model to determine IC50 values using GraphPad PRISM software (version 9.0.0).The 50% inhibitory dilution (EC50) was defined as the serum dilution at which the relative light units (RLUs) were reduced by 50% compared with the virus control wells (virus + cells) after subtraction of the background RLUs in the control groups with cells only.The EC50 values were calculated with non-linear regression, log (inhibitor) versus normalized response using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).The neutralization assay was positive if the serum achieved at least 50% inhibition at 1 in 3 dilution of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped virus in the neutralization assay.The neutralization result was negative if it failed to achieve 50% inhibition at 1 in 3 dilution.",0,1
