0,"Recurrent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 spike deletion H69/V70 and its role in the Alpha variant B.1.1.7SummaryWe report severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike ΔH69/V70 in multiple independent lineages, often occurring after acquisition of receptor binding motif replacements such as N439K and Y453F, known to increase binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor and confer antibody escape.In vitro, we show that, although ΔH69/V70 itself is not an antibody evasion mechanism, it increases infectivity associated with enhanced incorporation of cleaved spike into virions.ΔH69/V70 is able to partially rescue infectivity of spike proteins that have acquired N439K and Y453F escape mutations by increased spike incorporation.In addition, replacement of the H69 and V70 residues in the Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike (where ΔH69/V70 occurs naturally) impairs spike incorporation and entry efficiency of the B.1.1.7 spike pseudotyped virus.Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster kinetics of cell-cell fusion than wild-type Wuhan-1 D614G, dependent on ΔH69/V70.Therefore, as ΔH69/V70 compensates for immune escape mutations that impair infectivity, continued surveillance for deletions with functional effects is warranted.Graphical abstractHighlightsSpike ΔH69/V70 does not confer escape from antibodiesSpike ΔH69/V70 increases cleaved S2 and spike infectivityB.1.1.7 requires ΔH69/V70 for efficient cleaved spike incorporation and infectivityB.1.1.7 spike requires ΔH69/V70 for rapid syncytium formationMeng et al.report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike ΔH69/V70 has arisen multiple times.The deletion increases entry efficiency associated with increased cleaved spike in virions and can compensate for loss of infectivity.The B.1.1.7 spike requires ΔH69/V70 for efficient cell entry and cell-cell fusion activity.IntroductionSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike surface glycoprotein engagement of human angiotensin-converting enzyme (hACE2) is essential for virus entry and infection, and the receptor is found in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.",0
1,"The deletion increases entry efficiency associated with increased cleaved spike in virions and can compensate for loss of infectivity.The B.1.1.7 spike requires ΔH69/V70 for efficient cell entry and cell-cell fusion activity.IntroductionSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike surface glycoprotein engagement of human angiotensin-converting enzyme (hACE2) is essential for virus entry and infection, and the receptor is found in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.Despite this critical interaction and the imposed constraints, it appears that the receptor binding domain (RBD) is relatively tolerant to mutations, raising the real possibility of virus escape from past infection or vaccine-induced immunity and monoclonal antibody treatments.Spike mutants exhibiting reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies have been identified in in vitro screens, and some of these mutations have been found in clinical isolates.Studying chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection can give insights into virus evolution that would require many chains of acute transmission to generate.This is because the majority of infections arise as a result of early transmission during pre- or asymptomatic phases prior to peak adaptive responses, and virus adaptation is not observed because the virus is usually cleared by the immune response.We recently documented de novo emergence of antibody evasion mutations mediated by spike gene mutations in an individual treated with convalescent plasma (CP).In addition, a chronically infected immune-suppressed individual has been reported recently in Russia with emergence of Y453F along with ΔH69/V70.Deletions in other parts of the N-terminal domain (NTD) have been reported to arise in chronic infection and reduce sensitivity to NTD-specific neutralizing antibodies.Here we analyze global SARS-CoV-2 data and find that ΔH69/V70 occurs independently, often emerging after a significant RBD amino acid replacement, such as Y453F and N439K, which are known to facilitate neutralizing antibody escape or alter ACE2 binding while incurring an infectivity defect, according to some reports.Although structural modeling indicates that H69/V70 is in an exposed loop that contracts after deletion, potentially altering an antigenic site, we report that the ΔH69/V70 does not confer significantly reduced susceptibility to convalescent sera or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).Functionally, we find that ΔH69/V70 does increase spike infectivity and compensates for an infectivity defect resulting from the RBD replacements N439K and Y453F.The infectivity increase is driven by higher levels of spike incorporation into virions.We demonstrate that the deletion is required for optimal infectivity of the 501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7) spike protein.We show that, although B.1.1.7 and the wild-type (WT) spike pseudotyped virus (PV) have similar infectivity on a range of target cell types, the B.1.1.7 spike protein alone induces more rapid cell-cell fusion and formation of multinucleated cells.",1
2,"We demonstrate that the deletion is required for optimal infectivity of the 501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7) spike protein.We show that, although B.1.1.7 and the wild-type (WT) spike pseudotyped virus (PV) have similar infectivity on a range of target cell types, the B.1.1.7 spike protein alone induces more rapid cell-cell fusion and formation of multinucleated cells.Repair of the two amino acids not only leads to reduced B.1.1.7 spike incorporation into virions and impaired infectivity but also reduces cell-cell fusion kinetics back to WT levels.ResultsMultiple occurrences and transmission of spike ΔH69/V70 with and without spike mutationsGlobal snapshot of SARS-CoV-2 lineages associated with ΔH69/V70 and RBM mutations(A) Maximum-likelihood phylogeny of global SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences, highlighting those with specific mutations in spike: ΔH69/V70, N439K, Y453F, and N501Y.The tree is subsampled, and tips are colored by geographic region (see key).Grey bars on the right show the presence or absence of the ΔH69/V70 and amino acid variants N439K, Y453F, and N501Y.Pangolin lineages are shown.(B and C) Cumulative occurrences of SARS-CoV-2 sequences with ΔH69/V70 by month for (B) ΔH69/V70 with or without N439K/Y453F and (C) ΔH69/V70 with N501Y.Indicated frequencies are by month, and all data were collected from the GISAID database (http://gisaid.org, accessed May 21, 2021) and sorted by reporting country and sampling date.The deletion H69/V70 is present in over 600,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences worldwide and has seen global expansion, particularly across much of Europe, Africa, and Asia (Figure 1).ΔH69/V70 is observed in multiple global lineages (Figure 1A).Although variants with deletions in this region of spike are observed in GISAID, the earliest unambiguous sequences that included the ΔH69/V70 were detected on a D614 background in January 2020 (United States and Thailand).The earliest ΔH69/V70 detected on a D614G background occurred in Sweden in April 2020.Prevalence of ΔH69/V70 has increased since August 2020 (Figure 1B).",2

To explore whether D614G was required for this enhanced spike cleavage and infectivity, we generated PVs bearing D614 spike with and without ΔH69/V70, followed by infection of HEK293T cells.We observed a similar 2-fold enhancement of infection and a proportional increase in spike incorporation as we did for D614G spike PVs (Figures S1A and S1B).Finally, to exclude the possibility that increased incorporation of S was specific for pseudotyped lentiviral particles, we generated coronavirus-like particles by co-transfection of WT or ΔH69/V70 S with SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, as described previously.Compared with levels of N, levels of cleaved S in coronavirus-like particles were again enhanced in the presence of the ΔH69/V70 (Figures S1C and S1D).Enhanced infectivity of ΔH69/V70 spike is not correlated with cleavage or entry routeThe route of SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated virus entry in cell lines is not altered by ΔH69/V70 spike(A) Schematic illustrating spike in producer cells with CMK targeting and blocking furin cleavage (left panel).In target cells, camostat inhibits TMPRSS2 and, therefore, cell fusion at the plasma membrane, and E64D blocks cathepsins and targets endocytic viral entry (right panel).(B) Western blots show that CMK inhibits spike S1/S2 cleavage in producer cells transfected with the S ΔH69/V70 plasmid, and spikes with altered S1/S2 cleavage are incorporated into the virions.Antibodies against HIV-1 p24 and spike S2 were used with anti-GAPDH as a loading control.(C) The viruses produced from transfected HEK293T cells in the presence of CMK were used to transduce target cells.The luciferase reading is used as a surrogate for the spike infectivity bearing with various S2/FL ratios.The data shown are technical triplicates or quadruplicates, and statical analysis was done using an unpaired t test.(D) Comparison of the infectivity of spike with the PBCS deleted (ΔPBCS) with and without ΔH69/V70.The effect of ΔH69/V70 is independent of the PBCS.(E) ΔH69/V70 does not alter the virus entry route.S pseudotyped lentiviruses bearing WT S, ΔH69/V70 S, or VSV-G were used to transduce 293T-ACE2 or 293T-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells in the presence of E64D or camostat at different drug concentrations.",7
8,"(E) ΔH69/V70 does not alter the virus entry route.S pseudotyped lentiviruses bearing WT S, ΔH69/V70 S, or VSV-G were used to transduce 293T-ACE2 or 293T-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells in the presence of E64D or camostat at different drug concentrations.The cells were then harvested after 2 days and assayed for luciferase expression, which was then normalized against the non-drug control (set as 100%).The data shown are technical duplicates.The data are representative of at least two independent experiments.SARS-CoV-2 entry into target cells is thought to take place by two distinct routes following binding to ACE2 (Figure 4A).The first is an endosomal route where cathepsin is able to cleave spike with pH-dependent fusion in the endosome.The second route involves fusion at the plasma membrane with cleavage via the plasma membrane-associated protease TMPRSS2.To determine the mechanism by which increased spike cleavage in the context of ΔH69/V70 might affect entry, we used an inhibitor of furin cleavage (CMK) and protease inhibitors specific to the endosomal (ED64D) and plasma membrane fusion (camostat) entry routes (Figure 4A).We first treated producer cells with CMK and found that CMK inhibits spike S1/S2 cleavage in producer cells transfected with the S ΔH69/V70 plasmid and that the spikes with altered S1/S2 cleavage are incorporated into the virions (Figure 4B).We found that CMK treatment, although reducing S1/S2 cleavage, did not decrease PV infection in a variety of target cells (Figure 4C), suggesting that the increased infectivity in ΔH69/V70 is not due to more efficient cleavage of spike.To confirm our findings, we generated a spike lacking the polybasic cleavage site (PBCS) with or without ΔH69/V70 and tested PV infectivity on HEK293T cells overexpressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2.We found that deletion of the polybasic cleavage site led to increased infectivity of the PV, as observed previously for mutated PBCS.As expected, deletion of the PBCS did not alter the enhancing effect of ΔH69/V70 on PV infectivity (Figure 4D).The altered level of S1/S2 cleavage in SARS-CoV-2 has been linked to its dependence on viral entry through membrane fusion or endocytosis in HEK293T and A549 cells.We therefore hypothesized that the increased spike cleavage of ΔH69/V70 S could influence the route of entry.To probe this, spike pseudotyped lentiviruses bearing WT spike, ΔH69/V70 spike, or vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) were used to transduce HEK293T-ACE2 or HEK293T-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells in the presence of E64D or camostat at different drug concentrations (Figure 4E).",8
9,"We therefore hypothesized that the increased spike cleavage of ΔH69/V70 S could influence the route of entry.To probe this, spike pseudotyped lentiviruses bearing WT spike, ΔH69/V70 spike, or vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) were used to transduce HEK293T-ACE2 or HEK293T-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells in the presence of E64D or camostat at different drug concentrations (Figure 4E).As expected, the VSV-G pseudotyped particles were not affected by addition of E64D or camostat.Consistent with previous observations, the WT PV utilized endocytosis in the absence of TMPRSS2, but where TMPRSS2 was expressed, plasma membrane fusion became the dominant route.However, there were no differences between WT and ΔH69/V70 in relative utilization of the endosomal versus plasma membrane entry routes.We conclude that the enhanced spike cleavage, although notable in ΔH69/V70, does not appear to be responsible for the increased infectivity of ΔH69/V70 spike observed in these cell line-based experiments.ΔH69/V70 spike compensates for reduced infectivity of RBD escape mutantsΔH69/V70 appears after spike N439K and Y453F and compensates for their reduced infectivity(A and B) Maximum-likelihood phylogeny of global sequences carrying Spike mutant (A) N439K and (B) Y453F.All sequences in the GISAID database containing S:439K or S:Y453F (February 18, 2021) were downloaded, realigned to Wuhan-Hu-1 using MAFFT, and deduplicated.(C) Representation of the Spike RBM:ACE2 interface (PDB: 6M0J) with residues N439, Y453, and N501, highlighted as spheres colored by element.(D–F) Spike mutant ΔH69/V70 compensates for the infectivity defect of spike RBD mutations and is associated with increased spike incorporation into virions.(D) Infectivity of spike (D614G) ΔH69/V70 in the absence and presence of spike RBD mutations.Shown is single-round infection by luciferase-expressing lentiviruses pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on target HeLa cells stably transduced with ACE2.Mean and SEM are shown.(E) Representative western blot of purified virions and cell lysates probed with antibodies against HIV-1 p24, SARS-CoV-2 spike S2, and GAPDH.(F and G) Densitometric quantification of the (F) spike:p24 and (G) cleaved S2 spike:FL spike ratios for spike (D614G) ΔH69/V70 in the absence and presence of spike RBD mutations across multiple experiments in pelleted viruses.U, unit of reverse transcriptase (RT) activity.Data are representative of at least two independent experiments.",9

B.1.1.7 appeared to mediate more cell-cell fusion events over earlier time points, with the color overlap area being 2–3 times greater for B.1.1.7 compared with the WT 6 h after mixing.Interestingly, this enhancement was abrogated by re-insertion of the H69 and V70 residues (Figures 7B–7D).We conclude that B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster fusion kinetics than the WT bearing D614G Wuhan-1 spike that is dependent on ΔH69/V70.ΔH69/V70 does not enhance infectivity of bat coronavirus RaTG13 spikeFinally, to investigate the importance of this part of spike beyond SARS-CoV-2 for other coronaviruses with zoonotic potential, we examined the 69/70 region of spike in a set of other known sarbecoviruses (Figures S4A–S4C).",14
15,"Interestingly, this enhancement was abrogated by re-insertion of the H69 and V70 residues (Figures 7B–7D).We conclude that B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster fusion kinetics than the WT bearing D614G Wuhan-1 spike that is dependent on ΔH69/V70.ΔH69/V70 does not enhance infectivity of bat coronavirus RaTG13 spikeFinally, to investigate the importance of this part of spike beyond SARS-CoV-2 for other coronaviruses with zoonotic potential, we examined the 69/70 region of spike in a set of other known sarbecoviruses (Figures S4A–S4C).We observed substantial variability in the region, resulting in frequent insertions or deletions (indels), with some viruses including SARS-CoV having 6- to 7-amino-acid deletions (Figure S4B).This is indicative of high structural plasticity in this protein region that could allow sarbecoviruses to alter their spike conformation.RaTG13 is the evolutionarily closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 for this region and, after RaTG13, is the cluster of 5 CoVs sampled in trafficked pangolins in the Guangxi province.Inspection of the 69/70 region in these virus sequences raises the interesting observation that one of the five viruses in the cluster, P2V, has amino acids 69H and 70L present, whereas the other four have a double amino acid deletion (Figures S4A–S4C).Given that SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the homologous HV insertion at these positions, one explanation is that the proximal common ancestor between SARS-CoV-2 and the Guangxi pangolin cluster had the insertion, which was then lost while circulating in the pangolin population, similar to observations with SARS-CoV-2 in humans.However, the fact that P2V was cultured in Vero E6 cells prior to sequencing (contrary to the other 4, sequenced directly from the pangolin sample) raises the possibility of this being an independent insertion, favored as a monkey cell line-specific adaptation.Interestingly, the double amino acid indel in the pangolin viruses is in frame, in contrast to SARS-CoV-2.Furthermore, the two almost identical bat viruses sequenced recently from Cambodian samples, RShSTT182 and RShSTT200, possess an H69V70 insertion despite being more distantly related to SARS-CoV-2 for this region of spike (Figures S4A–S4C).This independent occurrence of the insertion is suggestive of context-dependent selective pressure playing a role in recurring gain and loss of these two residues in sarbecoviruses.To test whether the fitness effect associated with acquisition of ΔH69/V70 is specific to SARS-CoV-2 and not other sarbecovirus spike backgrounds, we cloned FL S from RaTG13 and generated pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing RaTG13 spike protein as well as a RaTG13 S ΔH69/V70 counterpart.",15
16,"This independent occurrence of the insertion is suggestive of context-dependent selective pressure playing a role in recurring gain and loss of these two residues in sarbecoviruses.To test whether the fitness effect associated with acquisition of ΔH69/V70 is specific to SARS-CoV-2 and not other sarbecovirus spike backgrounds, we cloned FL S from RaTG13 and generated pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing RaTG13 spike protein as well as a RaTG13 S ΔH69/V70 counterpart.We observed that cleaved and uncleaved S expression levels in the PV did not differ between WT and the ΔH69/V70 RaTG13 spike and that there was no difference in infectivity on target cells expressing ACE2 or ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Figures S4D and S4E).This result suggests that, as one would expect, the enhancing effect of ΔH69/V70 on spike levels and infectivity is specific to the spike background.DiscussionWe have presented data demonstrating multiple independent and circulating lineages of SARS-CoV-2 variants bearing spike ΔH69/V70.This recurring deletion, spanning 6 nt, is due to an out-of-frame deletion of 6 nt and occurs in the terminal loop of a helix loop motif within the predicted RNA structure, as do other NTD deletions observed in new variants, such as B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617 (Delta), B.1.351 (Beta), and P.1 (Gamma) (Figure S5).Stable helix loop motifs are associated with pausing/dissociation events in reverse transcriptase.Because all nucleic acid polymerases have a common ancestor with homologous dinucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) binding motifs and similar global structures, it is probable that all RNA polymerases use similar mechanisms for transcript termination.A recent in-cell biochemical analysis of SARS-CoV2 RNA structure showed nucleotide reactivity consistent with this model within these stem-loops.These analyses provide a rationale for preferential emergence of ΔH69/V70 and other deletions, such as the well-described NTD antibody escape deletion ΔY144 (in B.1.1.7 and the recently reported B.1.525) at the terminal loops of helical loop motifs.ΔH69/V70 itself has frequently followed immune escape-associated amino acid replacements in the RBD (e.g., N439K and Y453F) and is specifically found in the B.1.1.7 variant, known to have higher transmissibility and, possibly, pathogenicity.We find that ΔH69/V70 does not significantly reduce the sensitivity of spike to neutralizing antibodies in serum from a group of recovered individuals or binding of multiple mAbs directed against the NTD.In addition, we have shown that repair of ΔH69/V70 does not appreciably alter the potency of NTD antibodies against the B.1.1.7 spike.Thus, the deletion is unlikely to be an immune escape mechanism.",16
17,"In addition, we have shown that repair of ΔH69/V70 does not appreciably alter the potency of NTD antibodies against the B.1.1.7 spike.Thus, the deletion is unlikely to be an immune escape mechanism.Instead, our experimental results demonstrate that ΔH69/V70 is able increase infectivity of the Wuhan-1 D614G spike PV as well as the PV bearing the additional RBD mutations N439K or Y453F, explaining why the deletion is often observed after these immune escape mutations that carry infectivity cost.We show that the mechanism of enhanced infectivity across the RBD mutations tested is associated with greater spike incorporation into virions where ΔH69/V70 is present.The phenotype is also independent of producer cells used.Importantly, we were able to recapitulate the ΔH69/V70 phenotype in a spike protein that did not have the D614G mutation, indicating that D614G is not involved in the mechanism.These observations are supported by ΔH69/V70 being observed in D614 viruses in January 2020 in the United States and Thailand.Although we did not use a replication-competent system, a recent study reports that the ΔH69/V70 mutated Washington strain virus isolate confers increased replication in cell lines and higher viral loads in hamsters.Indeed, ΔH69 has been observed in cell culture during remdesivir selection experiments with a replication-competent virus, consistent with a replication advantage.We have found consistent differences in spike as well as cleaved spike in the producer cell and its incorporation into PV particles when comparing ΔH69/V70 with a Wuhan-1 spike (both with D614G).This could be explained by stability during intracellular trafficking or the route taken to the surface, differences in post-translational modification of the spike protein, or membrane characteristics at the budding site of virus or virus-like particles.Because the amount of spike incorporation into virions reflects the spike in the cells, virion formation is likely unaffected by ΔH69/V70.Interestingly, although pharmacological inhibition of furin by CMK in producer cells did prevent S1/S2 cleavage and altered the balance of S2:FL spike in cells and virions, PV infectivity was not reduced by drug treatment.These data suggest that the increase in entry efficiency conferred by spike ΔH69/V70 is independent of spike S1/S2 cleavage.Similar findings regarding the lack of relationship between the balance of S2:FL and infectivity have been reported in the context of furin knockout cells rather than furin inhibition with CMK.In addition, a recent report on the S1/S2 cleavage site mutation P681H demonstrated that enhanced cleavage of spike P681H was not associated with increased PV infectivity or cell fusion relative to the WT.",17
18,"Similar findings regarding the lack of relationship between the balance of S2:FL and infectivity have been reported in the context of furin knockout cells rather than furin inhibition with CMK.In addition, a recent report on the S1/S2 cleavage site mutation P681H demonstrated that enhanced cleavage of spike P681H was not associated with increased PV infectivity or cell fusion relative to the WT.There may, however, be differences in vivo.We explored the entry route of ΔH69/V70 spike using cathepsin inhibition to block endosomal entry and camostat to block entry via plasma membrane fusion.ΔH69/V70 spike was as sensitive to camostat and the cathepsin inhibitor ED64 as the WT, arguing that the efficiency of entry route is similar despite differences in cleaved spike.Although S1/S2 cleavage allows avoidance of endosome-associated IFITM restriction and appears to be critical for transmission in animal models, cleaved spike may be less infectious when S1 is shed prematurely, possibly conferring a disadvantage under some circumstances.In addition, showed that S1/S2 cleavage in the producer cell, conferred by a polybasic stretch at the cleavage site, is advantageous in cells expressing abundant TMPRSS2 but deleterious in cells lacking TMPRSS2.The Alpha variant Al (B.1.1.7), bearing seven spike mutations, is responsible for a new pandemic phase that is demonstrably more pathogenic and more transmissible.Detection of a high number of novel mutations suggests that this lineage has been introduced from a geographic region with very poor sampling or that viral evolution may have occurred in a single individual in the context of chronic infection.We show that Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike has similar infectivity as WT D614G spike, consistent with data on live B.1.1.7 virus in human airway epithelial cells but in contrast to another study that showed a difference in live virus with the 8 spike mutations.Importantly, however, we demonstrate loss of infectivity when the H69/V70 amino acids are replaced in B.1.1.7 S, accompanied, as expected, by reduced S1/S2 cleavage and reduced S incorporation into virions.These data point to epistatic interactions between observed mutations in spike of B.1.1.7 with a trade-off between mutations that incur virus entry cost with those that contribute to other activities, such as immune evasion.Of greatest potential importance is our observation that Alpha variant B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster syncytium formation and that this enhanced cell-cell fusion activity is dependent on ΔH69/V70.Syncytium formation is a key feature of severe and fatal COVID-19 and implicated in elevated viral replication.",18

35,"How to interpret and use COVID-19 serology and immunology testsBackgroundAlthough molecular tests are considered the gold standard for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnostics, serological and immunological tests may be useful in specific settings.ObjectivesThis review summarises the underlying principles and performance of COVID-19 serological and immunological testing.SourcesSelected peer-reviewed publications on COVID-19 related serology and immunology published between December 2019 and March 2021.ContentSerological tests are highly specific but heterogeneous in their sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19.For certain indications, including delayed disease presentations, serological tests can have added value.The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may indicate a recent or past COVID-19 infection.Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) antibody tests have the advantages of being easy and fast to perform, but many have a low sensitivity in acute settings.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA) have higher sensitivities.Besides humoral immunity, cellular immunity is also essential for successful host defences against viruses.Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays can be used to measure T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2.The presence of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cells in never exposed patients suggests the possibility of cellular immunity induced by other circulating coronaviruses.T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 have also been detected in recovered COVID-19 patients with no detectable antibodies.ImplicationsSerological and immunological tests are primarily applied for population-based seroprevalence studies to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 control measures and increase our understanding of the immunology behind COVID-19.Combining molecular diagnostics with serological tests may optimise the detection of COVID-19.As not all infected patients will develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, assessment of cellular immunity may provide complementary information on whether a patient has been previously infected with COVID-19.More studies are needed to understand the correlations of these serological and immunological parameters with protective immunity, taking into account the different circulating virus variants.IntroductionDiagnostics for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are mostly performed in case of a suspected acute respiratory infection or for screening of asymptomatic cases as part of outbreak management.Both aim to detect COVID-19 during the early phase of infection.",0
36,"More studies are needed to understand the correlations of these serological and immunological parameters with protective immunity, taking into account the different circulating virus variants.IntroductionDiagnostics for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are mostly performed in case of a suspected acute respiratory infection or for screening of asymptomatic cases as part of outbreak management.Both aim to detect COVID-19 during the early phase of infection.However, in some cases with negative molecular or antigen tests for COVID-19 but remaining high suspicion, it can be relevant to determine whether a patient has previously been infected with COVID-19.In those cases, serological tests may explain a particular clinical presentation, although it does not assess infectiousness.Moreover, serological tests are important to assess seroprevalence and evaluate the effectiveness of applied containment strategies at the community level.However, humoral immunity is just one part of our immune system.Cellular immunity also plays a potential role in the protection against COVID-19.This review summarises the basic principles of serological and immunological tests for COVID-19 and provides recommendations for its application.Humoral immunityAntibody and T-cell responses over time after SARS-CoV-2 infection.Immune responses can be highly heterogenous depending on various factors including patient characteristics and severity of illness.The presented figure is a simplified representation to increase general understanding, but can be variable for different individuals in different settings.Figure 1The humoral immunity is characterised by the production of antibodies by B cells as a response to antigens.Immunoglobulin (Ig)M quickly appears but has a short half-life (Figure 1 ).IgA is most abundant in mucosal surfaces but can also be found in serum, and arises within the first week of symptom onset.IgG is the most abundant antibody type and provides longer-lasting immunity.About 7 to 14 days after symptom onset, IgG against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is detectable in most patients.IgG titres remain stable for at least four to six months following diagnosis among COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed individuals, whereas IgA and IgM titres rapidly decay.Antibody titres remain negative in about 5% of symptomatic PCR-positive patients, whereas for asymptomatic PCR-positive patients 15% to 40% are seronegative.Several studies show that severe cases are associated with higher titres of antibodies and may have a later-onset antibody response in comparison to milder or asymptomatic patients.The presence of neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 after natural infection indicates protection against reinfection.However, the cut-off levels of neutralising antibodies for protection against reinfection remain to be elucidated.Vaccination also induces neutralising antibody production, causes protection against COVID-19 infection and reduces the severity of infection.",1
37,"However, the cut-off levels of neutralising antibodies for protection against reinfection remain to be elucidated.Vaccination also induces neutralising antibody production, causes protection against COVID-19 infection and reduces the severity of infection.However, the relative independent contributions of humoral and cellular immunity to this protection are difficult to determine.The presence of neutralising antibodies is considered a functional correlate of immunity and provides at least partial resistance to subsequent infections by virus antigen binding to prevent interaction with host cells.Although some serological assays showed a high correlation between IgG and neutralising antibodies, other assays have poor correlation.Therefore, comparison to virus neutralising tests is important as part of the validation of new serological assays.Most convalescent plasma samples obtained from individuals who recovered from COVID-19 do not contain high levels of neutralising activity.The antibodies targeting the spike glycoprotein, especially the receptor-binding domain (RBD) within the S1 subunit, show the highest neutralising capacity.The degree of cross-reaction to other epidemic and common human coronaviruses largely depends on the target sites to which the antibodies are directed; the S1 subunit is most specific and has the least homology regarding amino acid sequence with other coronaviruses, whereas the S2 subunit is more conservative.Previously infected individuals develop higher (neutralising) antibody responses in comparison to infection-naive individuals after one dose of mRNA vaccine vaccination, and this single-dose response is comparable or even stronger than in infection-naive individuals who received two vaccinations.It is of great concern that the presence of neutralising antibodies against one virus variant after natural infection or vaccination does not automatically mean equally effective protection against other variants.When vaccine-induced neutralising antibodies are in-vitro tested against different SARS-CoV-2 variants, reduced or abolished neutralising capacity was observed for the K417N, E484K and N501Y virus mutations.",2

these include antibodies against the RBD, nucleocapsid (N) protein, spike (S) protein, or nucleocapsid and spike (NS) proteins.LFIA is a rapid immunochromatography based method, which uses colloidal gold conjugated.SARS-CoV-2 antigens.Usually, it requires only a few drops of whole blood from a finger prick placed onto the test strip, whereafter the sample migrates towards fixed bands of bound SARS-CoV-2 antigens.If the sample contains SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, these will bind with the antigens, resulting in a visible band.Advantages of LFIA include their speed (~15 minutes) and ease of use.ELISA is a plate-based assay of which the microtiter wells are coated with SARS-CoV-2 antigens.After adding the sample, antigen-specific antibodies will bind to these antigens.After washing, a conjugate that binds to the antigen-antibody complex is added.A substrate is added, which will react with the conjugate, resulting in a colour change.The amount of colour change is a quantitative measure of the number of antibodies present in the sample.ELISA is easily adaptable to automation for high throughput.CLIA utilises chemiluminescence to quantify the level of antibodies present in the sample.SARS-CoV-2 antigens are conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate and bound to magnetic particles.Antibodies in the sample bind to antigens and are then visualised by chemiluminescence using a detection antibody.Advantages of CLIA include the wide dynamic range, high signal intensity, absence of interfering emissions, and high stability of reagents.In contrast to LFIA, which generates only qualitative results, ELISA and CLIA also yield quantitative results.For any serological method, false-positive results due to cross-reactivity are uncommon, with a reported specificity ranging from 96% to 100%.In a meta-analysis, pooled sensitivity of LFIA was 78% (95% confidence interval (CI) 71%-83%), of ELISA 86% (95%CI 82% - 89%), and of CLIA 92% (95%CI 86% - 95%).",4

42,"Responses against S protein primarily aim at the S2 domain, which shows great homology to the S2 domain of endemic coronaviruses.Cross-reactivity has also been observed against M, N and other non-S proteins and was more common among CD4+ T cells.T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 have also been detected in recovered COVID-19 patients with no detectable antibodies, indicating that in some cases, cellular immunity could be maintained independently of antibody responses.This finding is consistent with previous reports regarding SARS-CoV and MERS.Interestingly, using a bioinformatics approach, in silico data showed the presence of T-cell cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 peptides and several allergens that could be beneficial against COVID-19 in atopic individuals.To achieve protective immunity, vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 should elicit effective and lasting T-cell responses in addition to the induction of neutralising antibodies.In clinical trials, mRNA-1273 (Moderna ) vaccine induced CD4+ Th1-biased and CD8+ T-cell responses, with a lack of Th2 cytokine responses, demonstrating a favourable immunological signature.Similar results have been reported for another mRNA vaccine (i.e., BNT162b2, Pfizer/BioNTech ) and a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (i.e., ChAdOx1, University of Oxford/AstraZeneca ).In the latter, S-specific T-cell responses peaked at day 14 of vaccination and were still detectable on day 56.Previously infected individuals develop much stronger T-cell responses against spike protein peptides in comparison to infection-naive individuals after one dose of mRNA vaccine vaccination.ELISpotEnzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) is an antigen-specific T-cell functional assay that can measure the proportion of T-cells producing a specific cytokine (Table 1).It is a highly sensitive approach and has been used to assess SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses.IFNgamma-secreting T cells were reactive against M, N and S peptides in 70% to 100% of convalescent COVID-19 patients depending on the specific antigens and techniques used in the test.Illness severity is correlated with anti-M and anti-S T-cell responses.IFNgamma-ELISpot assays have also been used for the assessment of cellular responses after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, with vaccine candidates reporting robust S-specific T-cell responses after vaccination.",7
43,"Illness severity is correlated with anti-M and anti-S T-cell responses.IFNgamma-ELISpot assays have also been used for the assessment of cellular responses after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, with vaccine candidates reporting robust S-specific T-cell responses after vaccination.As ELISpot assay cannot provide further information about the exact cytokine-producing cell types, intracellular cytokine staining with flow cytometry can be used to identify specific cell subpopulations and the presence of polyfunctional cells.Recommendations for clinical practiceAlthough several aspects of the hosts' immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 remain to be further unravelled, some serological and immunological tests can be used to gain valuable information.Humoral immunity responses are variable and highly dependent on various assay-based and host factors.Hence, the optimisation of a standardised approach regarding the correct timing and the appropriate type of serology test that should be performed in different disease phases, severity classes, patient ages and settings remains challenging.Although the diagnostic utility of serological testing in the acute phase of illness is limited, it can be used for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics in case of unavailability of molecular diagnostic tests in, e.g., resource-deprived settings.However, in such settings also rapid antigen tests can be considered.Antibody tests may also be utilised when molecular test results are inconclusive or in cases of late-onset post-infectious complications, such as the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).In patients who are highly suspected of COVID-19 but in whom the molecular test was negative, serological testing may be helpful to yet establish the diagnosis.As point-of-care serological tests enable a timely and convenient way of antibody testing, they may be preferred when rapid results are needed or when access to central laboratories requires precarious logistics, like community-based screening, non-referral hospitals, outpatient practice or in home-based settings.Self-sampling approaches might be useful in population-based screening studies, but further validation is needed.Most importantly, serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 are necessary for population-based epidemiological surveillance.Serological tests are useful for public health policymaking to address the extent of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the community and assess the effectiveness of infection control strategies.The introduction of community-wide vaccination programs may complicate the interpretation of serological test results.The majority of currently available vaccines induce anti-S protein or anti-RBD neutralising antibody response.Consequently, assays targeting only anti-S protein or anti-RBD antibodies will not be able to discriminate between natural and post-vaccination induced immunity.Nevertheless, the measurable effect of post-vaccination immune response is of great significance for the affirmation of SARS-CoV-2 immune communities.",8
44,"Consequently, assays targeting only anti-S protein or anti-RBD antibodies will not be able to discriminate between natural and post-vaccination induced immunity.Nevertheless, the measurable effect of post-vaccination immune response is of great significance for the affirmation of SARS-CoV-2 immune communities.As of writing this review, community-wide monitoring of antibody levels after vaccination to determine whether sufficient protection levels have been obtained, is not recommended according to most guidelines.Nevertheless, it is conceivable to consider measuring vaccine response in patients' groups that are at high risk for reduced immune responses, e.g., immunocompromised patients, and to identify those with insufficient protection despite completing the standard vaccination schedule.However, this needs to be further evaluated in clinical studies, and more supporting evidence to reach consensus on cut-off values for presumed protection is mandatory.The choice of antibody testing strategy and interpretation of the results should be based on the assay performance characteristics and serological tests should only be used in settings where the prevalence is not too low.Otherwise, even a very high specific test can lead to a substantial absolute number of false-positive results when the prevalence is very low.Moreover, when tests have low specificities, combining different tests may be applied to increase overall specificity and maintain high sensitivity rates.Finally, many information gaps need to be clarified regarding long-term antibody kinetics and T-cell responses after natural infections by various SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccination strategies.Longitudinal studies should be employed in order to delineate the clinical sensitivity and specificity rates of serology and immunology tests in various settings with different prevalence.ConclusionSerological tests provide information about previous COVID-19 infections or vaccinations.They are not suitable as stand-alone diagnostics for acute-phase infections.However, in cases of more prolonged existing symptoms and when molecular diagnostic results are unavailable or inconclusive, serological diagnostics could identify additional COVID-19 cases among suspected patients.Awareness of the limitations of serological and immunological tests in a particular setting is required, because of the large heterogeneity in test performance of different assays.Currently, it remains uncertain how serological and immunological parameters are precisely correlated with the extent of protective immunity.Conflict of interestRFC: Research Grants from Gilead, Pulmotec, Janssen, Karius, Chimerix, Merck, Viracor, Takeda/Shire, and Ansun Pharmaceuticals.Advisory Board/Consultant for ADMA Biologics, Pulmotec, Ablynx, Janssen, Merck, ReViral, Kyorin, Chimerix, Partner Therapeutics, and Ansun Pharmaceuticals.",9

48,"Human‐to‐animal transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 is well‐documented in pets (Hosie et al., ), which typically become infected after exposure to owners with COVID‐19 (OIE).However, the impact of infections with SARS‐CoV‐2 variants of concern on the clinical presentation and duration of infection in pets and the transmissibility between people and pets remains unknown.Since June 2020, we have conducted a longitudinal household transmission study of pets living with one or more persons with COVID‐19 (Hamer et al.,) to better understand the role of virus transmission between humans and pets.As part of this ongoing study, two pets from the same household were sampled for SARS‐CoV‐2 on 12 February 2021, two days after their owner—one of two residents in a home in Brazos County, Texas—received a positive test result for COVID‐19 through a commercial laboratory; no viral sequence was generated from the owner.The pets—the only animals in the home—were a 15‐year‐old Labrador retriever mix dog and a 12‐year‐old domestic shorthair cat.On initial visit, the animals were asymptomatic.The owner described a high degree of contact with both pets, including sleeping in the same room (dog) and bed (cat).Following previously described methods (Hamer et al.,), oral, nasal and fur swabs from both pets were found to be positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 by real‐time (RT) PCR.Rectal swabs tested negative.Sera tested negative for SARS‐CoV‐2 neutralizing antibodies using a 96‐well virus neutralization test as previously described (Table 1; McAloose et al.,).Live virus isolation was attempted from all positive samples and was successful from the cat's nasal swab.SARS‐CoV‐2 whole‐genome sequencing was attempted and successful from the cat's nasal swab and the dog's oral swab.Consensus sequences from both animals were 100% identical to each other and were identified as the B.1.1.7 variant of concern by single‐nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis and alignment.In addition to characteristic B.1.1.7 mutations, sequences from both animals also showed 8 SNPs in ORF1ab and ORF8.Longitudinal SARS‐CoV‐2 test results for a pet dog and cat from the same household in Texas that were confirmed for infection with the B.1.1.7.",1

Neutralizing antibodies were detected in both animals (Table 1).This study documents the first detection of B.1.1.7.in companion animals in the United States, and the first genome recovery and isolation of B.1.1.7 variant of concern globally in any animal.These findings are coincident with detection of B.1.1.7 infection in rectal swabs of three U.K. pets with myocarditis (Ferasin et al.,).These results support public health guidance that recommends people with COVID‐19 isolate from animals (CDC, ) and the continued application of a One Health approach to SARS‐CoV‐2 investigations.Given the continued emergence (Galloway et al.,) and enhanced transmissibility and pathogenicity of B.1.1.7 in humans (Davies, Abbott, et al., ), onward transmission of this and other variants of concern from animals should remain the subject of ongoing research.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTThe authors declare no conflict of interest.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSS.A.H, R.

53,"Impact and effectiveness of mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations, and deaths following a nationwide vaccination campaign in Israel: an observational study using national surveillance dataBackgroundFollowing the emergency use authorisation of the Pfizer–BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 (international non-proprietary name tozinameran) in Israel, the Ministry of Health (MoH) launched a campaign to immunise the 6·5 million residents of Israel aged 16 years and older.We estimated the real-world effectiveness of two doses of BNT162b2 against a range of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes and to evaluate the nationwide public-health impact following the widespread introduction of the vaccine.MethodsWe used national surveillance data from the first 4 months of the nationwide vaccination campaign to ascertain incident cases of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and outcomes, as well as vaccine uptake in residents of Israel aged 16 years and older.Vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 outcomes (asymptomatic infection, symptomatic infection, and COVID-19-related hospitalisation, severe or critical hospitalisation, and death) was calculated on the basis of incidence rates in fully vaccinated individuals (defined as those for whom 7 days had passed since receiving the second dose of vaccine) compared with rates in unvaccinated individuals (who had not received any doses of the vaccine), with use of a negative binomial regression model adjusted for age group (16–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65–74, 75–84, and ≥85 years), sex, and calendar week.The proportion of spike gene target failures on PCR test among a nationwide convenience-sample of SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens was used to estimate the prevelance of the B.1.1.7 variant.FindingsDuring the analysis period (Jan 24 to April 3, 2021), there were 232 268 SARS-CoV-2 infections, 7694 COVID-19 hospitalisations, 4481 severe or critical COVID-19 hospitalisations, and 1113 COVID-19 deaths in people aged 16 years or older.By April 3, 2021, 4 714 932 (72·1%) of 6 538 911 people aged 16 years and older were fully vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2.",0

58,"When seeking testing, individuals provide their identification number and a specimen is collected via nasal or nasopharyngeal swab.Specimens are tested, using national testing standards, at one of 48 clinical diagnostic laboratories with use of real-time PCR tests.B.1.1.7 prevalence was estimated on the basis of swabs tested at Leumit with the TaqPath COVID-19 test (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pleasanton, CA, USA), which identifies spike gene target failure (SGTF) associated with gene mutations that cause deletions of amino acids 69 and 70 in the spike protein.Because these mutations are found in B.1.1.7, SGTF is used to estimate the prevalence of this variant.Public health surveillanceMoH conducts surveillance for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, with mandatory daily reporting of PCR results by all diagnostic laboratories.An epidemiological investigation, including an interview about COVID-19 symptoms, is done for each SARS-CoV-2 infection, usually within 2 days of diagnosis.MoH also conducts surveillance of COVID-19-associated hospitalisations.Daily updates are received from all hospitals and linked to the national database using patients' identification numbers.Hospitalisations are classified as severe (if a patient has a resting respiratory rate of >30 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation on room air of <94%, or a ratio of PaO2 to FiO2 of <300) or critical (in the event of mechanical ventilation, shock, or cardiac, hepatic, or renal failure).In accordance with national guidelines, health-care providers attributed any hospitalisations and deaths among individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection to COVID-19.OutcomesVaccine effectiveness estimates were assessed against six SARS-CoV-2 outcomes, comprising asymptomatic infections and five other hierarchical laboratory-confirmed outcomes: all SARS-CoV-2 infections (symptomatic and asymptomatic), symptomatic COVID-19 cases, and COVID-19-related hospitalisations, severe or critical hospitalisations (including those who died), and deaths.Asymptomatic infection was defined as a person with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who reported no fever and no respiratory symptoms during the symptom interview portion of the epidemiological investigation, and who was not subsequently hospitalised for or did not die from COVID-19.Statistical analysisIndividuals were defined as unvaccinated if they had not received any doses of BNT162b2, and as fully vaccinated if at least 7 days had passed since receiving the second dose of BNT162b2.Incidence rates were calculated for unvaccinated and fully vaccinated individuals aged 16 years and older for each SARS-CoV-2 outcome after excluding people with previous laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.",5
59,"Asymptomatic infection was defined as a person with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who reported no fever and no respiratory symptoms during the symptom interview portion of the epidemiological investigation, and who was not subsequently hospitalised for or did not die from COVID-19.Statistical analysisIndividuals were defined as unvaccinated if they had not received any doses of BNT162b2, and as fully vaccinated if at least 7 days had passed since receiving the second dose of BNT162b2.Incidence rates were calculated for unvaccinated and fully vaccinated individuals aged 16 years and older for each SARS-CoV-2 outcome after excluding people with previous laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.Data were stratified by age group (16–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65–74, 75–84, and ≥85 years, based on 2020 census data), sex, and calendar week.In the primary analysis, cases were categorised as vaccinated if the date of laboratory confirmation of infection occurred at least 7 days after the second dose of BNT162b2.Cases were excluded from the analysis if they had received only one dose, or had received two doses of BNT162b2 and fewer than 7 days had passed since the second dose.Person-days for the fully vaccinated group were ascertained each day by multiplying the proportion of people who were fully vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2 by the census estimates for each age stratum.Person-days for the unvaccinated group were determined each day by subtracting the number of person-days contributed by those who were vaccinated from the total census population for each age stratum; this process was repeated, summed, and aggregated for each day of the study period.Individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were excluded from person-day estimates.Using STATA (version 15), a negative binomial regression model (nbreg command), which is better suited for over-dispersion of variance than the traditional Poisson regression method, was used to derive incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% CIs for each outcome adjusted for age group, sex, and calendar week.The exposure command was used to account for varying patient-days across strata.Vaccine effectiveness estimates were calculated as (1 – IRR) × 100.In sensitivity analyses, vaccine effectiveness estimates were also calculated with the same method for people who had received two BNT162b2 doses and for whom at least 14 days had passed after the second dose, as well as for those who had received one dose and for whom 14–21 days had passed after the first dose.Role of the funding sourceThe Israel MoH and Pfizer separately provided in-kind support to this study.No funding was exchanged between the Israel MoH and Pfizer.",6

69,"Furthermore, even after reopenings occurred, SARS-CoV-2 incidence remained low, suggesting that high vaccine coverage might provide a sustainable path towards resuming normal activity.These data provide nationwide evidence of the beneficial public health impact of a COVID-19 vaccination campaign.During the study period, 95% of 8472 tested specimens showed an SGTF, associated with SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7, thereby providing evidence that BNT162b2 is effective against B.1.1.7.These findings are consistent with laboratory studies that indicated that BNT162b2 was likely to be effective against B.1.1.7.Notably, another clinically important variant, B.1.351, which was initially identified in South Africa, has recently been identified in Israel.Vaccine effectiveness against B.1.351, however, could not be estimated in our study because of the small number of B.1.351 infections identified in Israel during the study period.This study also suggests that two doses of BNT162b2 are effective against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections (with vaccine effectiveness estimates of 92% at ≥7 days after the second dose and 94% at ≥14 after the second dose).Estimates of effectiveness against asymptomatic infections were slightly lower than those against COVID-19, which could suggest a higher threshold of protection for asymptomatic infection compared with symptomatic illness.We conservatively defined asymptomatic infections as SARS-CoV-2 infections in interviewees who reported no fever and no respiratory symptoms at the time of the interview.Additionally, it is possible that some SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals who reported being asymptomatic at the time of interview might have instead been presymptomatic (ie, developed symptoms later).Although we made efforts to avoid this type of misclassification by excluding the small number of people who were initially reported to be asymptomatic but were later hospitalised for or died from COVID-19, some presymptomatic individuals who later developed symptoms without being hospitalised or dying might still have been included.This type of misclassification, however, was probably uncommon and would be unlikely to substantially influence the vaccine effectiveness estimate against asymptomatic infection.Notably, Israel's SARS-CoV-2 testing policy was different for unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals during the study period.At 7 days after the second dose, vaccinated individuals were exempt from the SARS-CoV-2 testing required of individuals who either had contact with a laboratory-confirmed case or returned from travel abroad.This testing policy might have resulted in a differential bias that would cause overestimation of vaccine effectiveness against asymptomatic infection (ie, asymptomatic people who received two doses were less likely to be tested than unvaccinated asymptomatic people).However, 19% of the 4·4 million PCR tests conducted during the study period were done on exempted individuals (MoH, unpublished data).Additionally, symptomatic individuals might have been reluctant to report symptoms for fear of being blamed for infecting other individuals, in which case asymptomatic vaccine effectiveness would also be overestimated.",16
70,"However, 19% of the 4·4 million PCR tests conducted during the study period were done on exempted individuals (MoH, unpublished data).Additionally, symptomatic individuals might have been reluctant to report symptoms for fear of being blamed for infecting other individuals, in which case asymptomatic vaccine effectiveness would also be overestimated.Conversely, individuals who were hesitant to receive a COVID-19 vaccine might also have been reluctant to seek SARS-CoV-2 testing, which would lead to underestimation of vaccine effectiveness against asymptomatic infection.Further studies are needed to confirm the magnitude of BNT162b2 protection against asymptomatic infection that we observed.Specifically, studies are needed to evaluate testing behaviour of vaccinated and unvaccinated people and to determine the extent to which prevention of asymptomatic infection leads to interruption of transmission.Two-dose BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness estimates from this observational study align with the 95% efficacy against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections shown in the pivotal RCT.Our study adds important new data about the effectiveness of BNT162b2 derived from outside of the RCT setting.We found high vaccine effectiveness against a wider range of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes (including severe COVID-19 and deaths) than were evaluated in the RCT, as well as high effectiveness in older adults with a level of precision not available in the RCT.In addition, although pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals were excluded from the RCT, these groups were recommended to receive BNT162b2 in Israel and an unknown number would, therefore, have been vaccinated.Finally, unlike the clinical trial, our study provides evidence that achieving high population-level coverage with BNT162b2 can lead to marked declines in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 outcomes.In the primary analysis of the Israel MoH surveillance data, we evaluated the effectiveness of two doses of BNT162b2, given Israel's adherence to the authorised two-dose 21-day vaccine schedule.In the sensitivity analysis, we showed moderate effectiveness of the vaccine against all SARS-CoV-2 outcomes at 14–21 days after the first dose.This finding is similar to those of studies from Israel early in the vaccine campaign and in the UK.Estimated effectiveness against all outcomes at 14–21 days after the first dose was lower than that of two doses at 7 days or longer or at 14 days or longer after the second dose, demonstrating the importance of fully vaccinating adults.Furthermore, despite indications of at least partial effectiveness after one dose of BNT162b2, relying on protection against COVID-19 from a single dose might not be prudent; BNT162b2 was developed and evaluated in the RCT as a two-dose schedule, and substantially lower levels of neutralising antibodies were observed after one dose compared with after two doses.",17
71,"Estimated effectiveness against all outcomes at 14–21 days after the first dose was lower than that of two doses at 7 days or longer or at 14 days or longer after the second dose, demonstrating the importance of fully vaccinating adults.Furthermore, despite indications of at least partial effectiveness after one dose of BNT162b2, relying on protection against COVID-19 from a single dose might not be prudent; BNT162b2 was developed and evaluated in the RCT as a two-dose schedule, and substantially lower levels of neutralising antibodies were observed after one dose compared with after two doses.Additionally, little is known about the duration of protection of one dose and how it compares with the durability after two doses.It is possible that one dose will provide a shorter duration of protection than two doses, particularly in an environment where new SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge.Our study has some limitations.In the absence of randomisation, there could have been unmeasured differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons (eg, different test-seeking behaviours or levels of adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions) which might have confounded our vaccine effectiveness estimates.Although we adjusted our estimates for age, sex, and calendar week, the effect of additional covariates such as location, comorbidities, race or ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and likelihood of seeking SARS-CoV-2 testing should be evaluated in future studies.Preliminary findings from a study in Israel, for example, indicate that neighbourhood might be an important confounder.Misclassification of exposures and outcomes in our study are potentially more common than in the RCT, although misclassification was probably limited by Israel's readily available SARS-CoV-2 testing and comprehensive surveillance system.Misclassification of vaccine history in our study was also unlikely because of comprehensive recording of vaccine administration in Israel.With nearly 7 weeks of follow-up after the second dose, our study has the longest follow-up reported so far, although longer-term data on effectiveness are needed.Another limitation is that the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation and death might have prevented identification of all hospitalisations and deaths during the study period.Such unidentified hospitalisations and deaths are unlikely, however, to be differential between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.Finally, given differences between countries in how vaccines are rolled out and in how the pandemic evolves, caution should be used in extrapolating our findings to other populations.Further real-world effectiveness studies of BNT162b2, and other COVID-19 vaccines, in other populations and settings are needed.Israel provides a unique opportunity to observe the nationwide impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmission of a rapidly increasing percentage of the population with vaccine-derived immunity.SARS-CoV-2 transmission is likely to continue until the proportion of the population with immunity exceeds a herd immunity threshold, which has been estimated to be at least 60%, although the emergence of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants could result in higher herd immunity thresholds.Achieving the SARS-CoV-2 herd immunity threshold might not be reached, however, without vaccinating some individuals younger than 16 years.",18

74,"Relative Mutant N501Y SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein RBD Inhibition of Anti-Spike Protein IgG and ACE-2 Binding to Spike Protein SpeciesThe coronavirus disease outbreak of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a newly emerging coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected more than 110 million people worldwide, resulting in more than 2.4 million deaths (500,000 in the U.S.), little more than 1 year after initial cases appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.It has now become apparent that neutralizing antibodies specific for the viral spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), which binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor on host cells, comprise the critical element of protective immunity to the virus (2).This contention is supported by the finding that the RBD is immunodominant and the target of 90% of the neutralizing activity present in SARS-CoV-2 immune sera (3).The BNT162b2 mRNA and mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, both coding for the spike glycoprotein, developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, respectively, elicit antibodies specific for the RBD and exhibit approximately 95% protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection (4-6).Several mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains have raised concerns regarding increased transmissibility, lethality, and escape from extant immunity, relative to the predominant pandemic strain, D614G, itself a mutant that arose soon after viral spread from Wuhan, China.Most notable of these mutant strains are B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1, which arose in the U.K., South Africa and Brazil, respectively, during late 2020 to early 2021(7-11).The South African variant is of concern, with 21 mutations, including 3 in the RBD, since it has been shown to exhibit reduced neutralization titers, not only against therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, but also COVID-19 convalescent and post-vaccination plasma samples (10-13).Recently, it has been confirmed that these reductions of neutralizing antibody function were sufficient to impair vaccine efficacy appreciably (14).Common to all of the three major variant strains is the RBD mutation N501Y, which signifies a substitution of L-tyrosine for L-asparagine at residue 501 of the spike protein.",0

After the blocking step, all incubations were followed by three washes with 0.02 M phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 with 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T).Test wells were coated with 5 µg recombinant spike protein (rSP; S1+S2; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN)/ml coating buffer (0.05 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6) overnight at 4° C. Well contents were aspirated and all wells (including background wells for each sample and standard dilution) were blocked for 1 hour with conjugate buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in 0.05 M Tris, pH 8.0, with 0.02% sodium azide).Human anti-SP IgG standards (chimera, GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) or human ACE-2 Fc (chimera, R&D Systems) in serial dilutions of 500-31.3 ng/ml PBS-T were incubated (n = 6) for 2 hours.All wells were then incubated with 3,000-fold diluted goat anti-human IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 1 hour.The assay was developed by adding substrate buffer (0.05 M glycine buffer, pH 10.5, with 1.5 mM magnesium chloride) to each well, followed by 4 mg paranitrophenylphosphate (PNPP)/ml substrate buffer (for a total volume of 100 µl/well) and incubating for 15 minutes.",1

78,"Inhibition curves of the anti-SP IgG chimera standard binding to the wild type spike protein (S1 + S2) in the rSP ELISA by the wild type RBD and the N501Y RBD (Fig.3B) were parallel, but different (all points, p < 0.05).The IC50 of the former was 20.8 nM, while that of the latter was 13.1 nM, indicating that the affinity of antibody binding to the N501Y RBD was actually nearly twice as great as to the wild type RBD.These data demonstrate that a) the Y501 spike protein does not have greater affinity for the ACE-2 receptor protein than the N501 SP; b) the Y501 spike protein may have an even greater affinity for a human monoclonal antibody specific for the wild type SP than the N501 SP; and c) recombinant RBD inhibition of ligand binding to immobilized spike protein or RBD is a valid approach to assessing the relevant molecular impact of viral mutations.Although there is ample evidence that the B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variant is more transmissible and less reactive with convalescent, post-vaccination, and therapeutic monoclonal neutralizing IgG antibodies than the predominant D614G pandemic strain, it is not at all clear what role the N501Y mutation plays in that shift.Most of the studies showing impaired antibody reactivity involved neutralization of whole virus infectivity in vitro.Neutralization of pseudoviruses engineered to express only the N501 or Y501 residues by 20 post-BNT162b2 vaccination sera was equivalent (6).Pseudoviruses engineered to express the K417N, E484K, N501Y and D614G residues, and to express the full B.1.351 mutations exhibited a 2.7- and 6.4-fold reduction, respectively, in neutralizing titer when compared to a pseudovirus possessing the D614G mutation alone, but retained sufficient neutralizing activity to ensure probable vaccine protection (11).However, dramatic decreases in the efficacy of three COVID-19 vaccines against the South African SARS-CoV-2 variant have been reported (14).Recently, an immunoassay technique was used to measure 1.351 RBD binding to acute, convalescent and post-vaccination plasma IgG antibodies relative to the B1 (wild type) RBD (Edara et al.)(20).Antibody binding magnitude was expressed in arbitrary units relative to a standard provided by the immunoassay manufacturer.Apparently, the 1.351 RBD contained all the mutations, but it is unclear how the protein was produced.Utilizing this approach, these investigators found that antibody binding to the 1.351 RBD was 3-fold lower than to the B1 RBD, which corresponded to a 3.5-fold lower neutralizing titer.",4
79,"Apparently, the 1.351 RBD contained all the mutations, but it is unclear how the protein was produced.Utilizing this approach, these investigators found that antibody binding to the 1.351 RBD was 3-fold lower than to the B1 RBD, which corresponded to a 3.5-fold lower neutralizing titer.They concluded that this reduction was not sufficient to compromise the protective efficacy of the antibodies.Next to Edara et al., the study reported here is one of the first to reflect direct ligand binding of a mutant RBD, rather than interference with whole virus infectivity.Contrary to expectations, we found no significant difference for the affinity of N501 and Y501 RBD binding to the ACE-2 receptor protein, and the Y501 RBD exhibited nearly twice the affinity for a human monoclonal IgG antibody specific for the wild type RBD as the N501 RBD.It has been speculated that the hydrogen bond between the Y501 residue and the Y41 residue of the ACE-2 protein contributes to an enhanced binding affinity compared to the N501 residue (9, 15, 17, 18).The O-H··N hydrogen bond, however, is stronger than the O-H··O bond, as opposed to the weaker N-H··O bond (21) and, since the N501 residue donates a hydrogen bond to the ACE-2 G352 (17), it is probably the recipient of the hydrogen bond donated by the Y41 residue.On the other hand, the N501-Y41 hydrogen bond is clearly sub-optimally aligned and separated by 3.7 Å, while the N487-Y83 bond is 2.7 Å (15), but it is unlikely that the Y501 mutant residue would be more favorably aligned.In any case, the results of this study support the conclusion that the enhanced binding of the B.1.351 virion to the ACE-2 receptor and its decreased binding affinity for IgG antibodies elicited by the D614G pandemic strain are due to spike protein RBD conformational changes provoked by multiple mutations, rather than the effect of a single mutation.These findings may help to a) implicate the nature of how viral mutations can increase transmissibility and virulence; b) provide an experimental approach to understanding mechanisms of interference with protective immunity; and c) suggest strategies for elucidating these mechanisms.In conclusion, a method has been developed, utilizing validated ELISAs for quantitation of human IgG antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the SP receptor binding domain (RBD), to compare the binding affinities of mutant RBDs for both the ACE-2 receptor protein and human anti-SP IgG antibodies.",5

81,"Characterization of entry pathways, species-specific ACE2 residues determining entry, and antibody neutralization evasion of Omicron BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3 variantsSince the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) with enhanced transmissibility, ACE2 binding affinity and immune evasive properties have emerged, including the most recent Omicron VOCs.Currently, Omicron (B.1.1.529) is comprised of five main lineages designated BA.1 (and its sublineage BA.1.1), BA.2 (and its sublineage BA.2.12.1), BA.3, BA.4, and BA.5.BA.1 was first identified in November 2021 in Botswana, and it rapidly replaced the then dominant Delta (B.1.617.2) VOC to become globally prevalent due to its enhanced transmissibility and ability to evade antibody neutralization 1–6.By early 2022, an alarming rise of BA.2 was seen in several parts of the world, leading to the replacement of BA.1 and BA.1.1.In comparison to BA.1, BA.2 was demonstrated to have faster replication kinetics, enhanced fusogenicity, and greater pathogenicity in hamsters 7,8.BA.4 and BA.5 are two new lineages that are presently emerging in South Africa.The spike protein of Omicron variants bears an unprecedented degree of antigenic divergence with the highest number of substitutions compared to ancestral B.1 (Wuhan-Hu-1, and D614G) variants and earlier VOCs.",0

85,"In cells expressing ACE2 but not TMPRSS2, spike-mediated entry follows the endosomal route, whereas in cells expressing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, spike-mediated entry occurs mainly at the cell surface.We investigated ACE2 preference and TMPRSS2 usage by examining the sensitivity of D614G and the Omicron (BA.1, BA.2, BA.3 and BA.1.1) variant pseudoviruses to endosomal and TMPRSS2 inhibitors, chloroquine and camostat mesylate, respectively.In 293T.ACE2 cells, chloroquine potently inhibited viral entry of both D614G and Omicron variants, but Omicron pseudoviruses were more sensitive to chloroquine (BA.1 IC50:2.06,p<0.001; BA.2 IC50:2.94,p<0.005; BA.3: 2.34,p<0.001; BA.1.1 IC50: 1.85,p<0.002) than D614G (IC50: 5.51) (Figure 2C).No chloroquine inhibition was observed in 293T.ACE2.TMPRSS2 cells (Figure 2D), suggesting that the presence of TMPRSS2 facilitates entry via the cell surface for all variants.D614G (IC50: 0.02) and Omicron (BA.1 IC50: 0.03; BA.2 IC50: 0.01; BA.3: 0.02; BA.1.1 IC50: 0.01) pseudoviruses displayed similar sensitivity to camostat mesylate in 293T.ACE2.TMPRSS2 cells (Figure 2E).These findings indicate greater sensitivity of Omicron pseudoviruses to endosomal entry inhibition compared to D614G.We further investigated ACE2 binding of Omicron variants by analyzing the sensitivity of D614G and Omicron pseudoviruses to soluble human ACE2 (sACE2) in a neutralization assay.Compared to D614G (IC50: 3.31 μg/ml), the BA.1 (IC50: 0.98μg/ml,p<0.0001), BA.2 (IC50: 0.99 μg/ml, p<0.0004) and BA.1.1 (IC50: 0.99 μg/ml, p<0.0005) variants demonstrated approximately 3-fold greater sensitivity to sACE2 whereas the BA.3 variant (IC50: 1.85 μg/ml, p<0.0005) showed 1.75-fold greater sensitivity to sACE2 (Figure 3).The sACE2 IC50 values reported here are comparable to previously reported values for D614G and BA.1 37.Pre-incubation of viruses at different temperatures can reveal differences in the stability of the viral glycoprotein trimers, including SARS-CoV-2 37,38.",4
86,"Compared to D614G (IC50: 3.31 μg/ml), the BA.1 (IC50: 0.98μg/ml,p<0.0001), BA.2 (IC50: 0.99 μg/ml, p<0.0004) and BA.1.1 (IC50: 0.99 μg/ml, p<0.0005) variants demonstrated approximately 3-fold greater sensitivity to sACE2 whereas the BA.3 variant (IC50: 1.85 μg/ml, p<0.0005) showed 1.75-fold greater sensitivity to sACE2 (Figure 3).The sACE2 IC50 values reported here are comparable to previously reported values for D614G and BA.1 37.Pre-incubation of viruses at different temperatures can reveal differences in the stability of the viral glycoprotein trimers, including SARS-CoV-2 37,38.We evaluated the effect of temperature on spike glycoprotein stability, and thus infectivity, by incubating D614G and Omicron variants pseudoviruses at 4°C, 25°C (room temperature or RT), 32°C, 37°C, 42°C and 50°C for an hour or 50°C for various periods of time before measuring their infectivity on 293T.ACE2 and 293T.ACE2.TMPRSS2 cells.We observed no significant differences in the infectivity of D614G and Omicron variants pseudoviruses after incubation at 4°C, RT, 32°C, 37°C, and 42°C (Figure 4).All viruses were relatively stable at 4°C, RT, 32°C, 37°C, and 42°C.Our findings are in agreement with a previous study where no differences in infectivity were observed between VSV-pseudotyped D614G and BA.1 VOC pseudoviruses upon extended incubation (72hrs) at 4°C, RT, and 37°C 37.However, infectivity of all pseudoviruses dramatically declined upon incubation at 50°C with no significant difference between D614G and Omicron variants pseudoviruses (Figure 4).Substitutions in the RBD have been linked to SARS-CoV-2 adaptation to new hosts, such as ferrets 39, mouse 33, mink 40 and white-tailed deer 41.The ongoing dominance and circulation of Omicron VOCs pose a significant risk for reverse zoonosis and spill back into the humans.Therefore, we investigated the ability of the Omicron (BA.1, BA.2, BA.3 and BA.1.1) variants to use ACE2 orthologs from ten diverse host species including African green monkey, Chinese rufous horseshoe bat, ferret, mouse, Chinese hamster, Syrian golden hamster, white-tailed deer, swine, bovine, and Malayan pangolin.293T cells transiently transfected with ACE2 receptors of each species were infected with pseudoviruses bearing spike proteins of D614G and the Omicron variants.We found that D614G pseudoviruses infected cells expressing ACE2 receptors of all the species well above the background except mouse, consistent with prior studies 3,33,42 (Figure 5A).Conversely, ACE2 receptors of all species, except horseshoe bat, supported infection by Omicron pseudoviruses (Figure 5B-E).293T cells with stable expression of human ACE2 (293T.ACE2) were used as a positive control.",5
87,"Conversely, ACE2 receptors of all species, except horseshoe bat, supported infection by Omicron pseudoviruses (Figure 5B-E).293T cells with stable expression of human ACE2 (293T.ACE2) were used as a positive control.We confirmed robust ACE2 expression for each species via Western blotting using the V5 tag at the C-terminus of these ACE2 proteins (Supplementary Figure 1).The Omicron pseudoviruses had significantly higher levels of infection than D614G pseudoviruses in cells expressing African green monkey, Chinese rufous horseshoe bat, ferret, mouse, Chinese hamster, Syrian golden hamster, white-tailed deer (save BA.1), swine, and bovine ACE2 receptors (Table 1).No significant difference between D614G and Omicron variants was observed with respect to Malayan pangolin ACE2 (Table 1).These findings indicate that the receptor binding motif (RBM) substitutions in the Omicron (BA.1, BA.2, BA.3 and BA.1.1) variants can modulate ACE2 receptor usage and therefore, Omicron variants’ entry.We next investigated the residues in D614G and Omicron spikes that allow or prevent infection of cells expressing horseshoe bat and mouse ACE2, respectively.Crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complexes show the ACE2 N-terminal helix cradled in the ridged concave surface formed by the spike RBM 43–46.Seventeen RBM residues contact ACE2 residues in its N terminus (Table 2).Among wild type SARS-CoV-2 RBM residues, Q498 interacts with D38, Y41, Q42, L45, and K353 residues of ACE2, while Q493 interacts with K31, H34, and E35 of ACE2, forming a network of hydrogen bonds 43–46.Structural and computational determination of Omicron RBD-ACE2 interactions revealed Q493R forming a new salt bridge with E35 while disrupting previous interactions of Q493 with K31 observed in wild type.The Q498R substitution also forms a new hydrogen bond and a salt bridge with ACE2 D38 and Q42 47–49.We assessed whether Q493R and Q498R substitutions in the RBM of Omicron spike facilitate entry of Omicron pseudoviruses in cells expressing mouse ACE2, or conversely, confer resistance to entry of cells expressing horseshoe bat ACE2.Pseudoviruses bearing Q493R and Q498R substitutions on the D614G background spike were therefore generated to infect 293T cells expressing ACE2 proteins of all the species described above.",6
88,"We assessed whether Q493R and Q498R substitutions in the RBM of Omicron spike facilitate entry of Omicron pseudoviruses in cells expressing mouse ACE2, or conversely, confer resistance to entry of cells expressing horseshoe bat ACE2.Pseudoviruses bearing Q493R and Q498R substitutions on the D614G background spike were therefore generated to infect 293T cells expressing ACE2 proteins of all the species described above.As expected, the Q493R substitution rescued pseudovirus infection in cells expressing mouse ACE2, but reduced pseudovirus infection in cells expressing horseshoe bat ACE2 to background levels (Table 1) (Figure 5F).The Q498R substitution also rescued infection in cells expressing mouse ACE2 above the background but had no effect on cells expressing horseshoe bat ACE2 (Table 1) (Figure 5G).As controls, the Omicron non-RBM S373P and mink adapted Y453F substitutions had no effect on pseudovirus entry in cells expressing mouse ACE2 or horseshoe bat ACE2 (Table 1) (Figure 5H and 5I).It is likely that the Q493R basic substitution in Omicron VOCs forms a salt bridge with the acidic E35 residue of mouse ACE2 or disrupts interaction with the basic K35 residue of horseshoe bat ACE2, thus facilitating or preventing infection of cells expressing mouse ACE2 and horseshoe bat ACE2 respectively (Table 2) (Figure 5J, 5K).Alternatively, the K35 residue in horseshoe bat ACE2 interacts with Q493 residue in D614G spike (Figure 5L).On the other hand, substitutions similar to Q498R were previously observed in mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (Q498H, Q498Y/P499T) to strengthen interaction with D38 of mouse ACE2, which otherwise forms an intramolecular salt bridge with H353 50–52 (Table 2) (Figure 5M).The interactions between R498 in Omicron spike and D38 and H353 in mouse ACE2 likely plays an important role for infection.For the remaining species, S373P, Y453F, Q493R, and Q498R substitutions phenocopied D614G in ACE2 usage (Figure 5F-5I).The Q493R substitution significantly enhanced the usage of all the remainder species, highlighting the role played by this substitution in enhancing ACE2 usage of Omicron variants, as described above (Figure 5F, Table 1).While S373P and Q498R substitutions had no significant effect compared to D614G, the mink-adapted Y453F substitution led to enhanced usage of African green monkey, ferret, Chinese hamster, Syrian golden hamster, white-tailed deer, and swine ACE2 receptors.",7
89,"The Q493R substitution significantly enhanced the usage of all the remainder species, highlighting the role played by this substitution in enhancing ACE2 usage of Omicron variants, as described above (Figure 5F, Table 1).While S373P and Q498R substitutions had no significant effect compared to D614G, the mink-adapted Y453F substitution led to enhanced usage of African green monkey, ferret, Chinese hamster, Syrian golden hamster, white-tailed deer, and swine ACE2 receptors.A previous report has indicated the Y453F substitution enhanced spike interaction with Mustela species ACE2 orthologs, including minks, ferrets and stouts, while not compromising human ACE2 usage (Figure 5I, Table 1) 40.Our findings extend this report and provide further insights into the effect of Y453F substitution for other species’ ACE2.We next evaluated the serum neutralizing activity in serum from vaccinated individuals who received three immunizations (two dose primary vaccine series and a third dose of booster) of the Pfizer/BNT162b2 vaccine.Receipt of a booster dose elicited significantly higher neutralization titers against D614G (GMT:7527) than two dose primary vaccine series, as seen previously 53.Furthermore, all serum samples had neutralizing activity against Omicron pseudoviruses after the receipt of a third booster dose.Neutralization titers against BA.1 (GMT:1087), BA.2 (GMT:961), BA.3 (GMT:916), and BA.1.1 (GMT:916) pseudoviruses were significantly reduced, 6.6-fold (p≤0.05), 7.8-fold (p≤0.0005), 8.2-fold (p≤0.0001), and 7.7-fold (p<0.0005) respectively, compared to D614G (GMT:7527) (Figure 6A).For two of the vaccinated individuals described above, we obtained serum samples one week prior to a third booster dose, as well as three weeks after the third booster.Therefore, we compared neutralization activity before and after the booster dose (pre- and post-boost respectively).We found 45.2-64.5-fold enhancement in post-boost neutralization titer compared to pre-boost titer for D614G and Omicron VOCs (Figure 6B).We also evaluated convalescent sera from five vaccinated individuals who experienced breakthrough infection post boost, when BA.1 or BA.1.1 variants were predominant (December 2021-January 2022).Serum samples from all individuals had the highest neutralization activity against D614G pseudoviruses (GMT: 16270) followed by lower neutralization against BA.1 (GMT: 6204), BA.2 (GMT: 3906), BA.3 (GMT: 5407) and BA.1.1 (GMT: 5873) variant pseudoviruses (Figure 6C).",8
90,"We found 45.2-64.5-fold enhancement in post-boost neutralization titer compared to pre-boost titer for D614G and Omicron VOCs (Figure 6B).We also evaluated convalescent sera from five vaccinated individuals who experienced breakthrough infection post boost, when BA.1 or BA.1.1 variants were predominant (December 2021-January 2022).Serum samples from all individuals had the highest neutralization activity against D614G pseudoviruses (GMT: 16270) followed by lower neutralization against BA.1 (GMT: 6204), BA.2 (GMT: 3906), BA.3 (GMT: 5407) and BA.1.1 (GMT: 5873) variant pseudoviruses (Figure 6C).Although the sample size is small, the results show similar resistance trends among these Omicron variants compared to D614G.In the present study we compared four Omicron lineage (BA.1, BA.2, BA.3 and BA.1.1) variants spikes for their ability to mediate virus entry in cells expressing human ACE2 in the presence or absence of TMPRSS2 and in cells expressing ACE2 orthologs of different species.We also assessed neutralization sensitivity of these spikes by soluble ACE2 and vaccine-elicited antibodies.We found that TMPRSS2 enhances Omicron (BA.1, BA.2, BA.3 and BA.1.1) pseudovirus infection relatively less than the B.1 (D614G) pseudovirus.In addition, compared to D614G, all Omicron lineage spikes more efficiently used ACE2 receptors from diverse animal species including mouse ACE2 but not horseshoe bat ACE2 for entry.Finally, we also observed that three doses of the Pfizer/BNT162b2 vaccine induced antibodies that had comparable levels of neutralization towards BA.1, BA.2, BA.3 and BA.1.1 Omicron lineages, although the neutralization titers against Omicron are 7-8-fold lower than those against D614G.Several recent studies demonstrated less enhancement of virus entry by TMPRSS2 for BA.1 pseudovirus infection compared to D614G and Delta pseudoviruses in ACE2/TMPRSS2-expressing cell lines (Calu3, Caco2, VeroE6/TMPRSS2), while no infection differences were observed in cell lines expressing ACE2 but not TMPRSS2 (VeroE6, H1299, HeLa-, HEK293T- and A549-ACE2) 6,54,55.Similar observations were reported in studies that performed authentic SARS-CoV-2 infections 6,54,55.Compared to D614G or the Delta VOC, Omicron variants (BA.1, BA.1.1) had attenuated or inefficient replication in TMPRSS2-positive lower airway or gall bladder organoids, Calu3, and Caco2 lung cell lines, but had no significant difference in cells with low or no TMPRSS2 expression (H1299, HeLa- and 293T-ACE2 cells) 6,36,55.",9
91,"Similar observations were reported in studies that performed authentic SARS-CoV-2 infections 6,54,55.Compared to D614G or the Delta VOC, Omicron variants (BA.1, BA.1.1) had attenuated or inefficient replication in TMPRSS2-positive lower airway or gall bladder organoids, Calu3, and Caco2 lung cell lines, but had no significant difference in cells with low or no TMPRSS2 expression (H1299, HeLa- and 293T-ACE2 cells) 6,36,55.Due to apparently less efficient use of TMPRSS2, Omicron variants appear to favor endocytic route of entry rather than TMPRSS2-mediated entry at the cell surface and consequently are more sensitive to endosomal inhibitors (chloroquine, bafilomycin A1 and E64d) 6,35.Our findings are consistent with the increased use of the endosomal entry pathway in cells expressing only ACE2, though we found that coexpression of TMPRSS2 enhanced infection.A possible mechanism that contributes to less efficient TMPRSS2 utilization by Omicron VOCs is the accumulation of multiple additional basic amino acid substitutions, leading to an overall positively charged Omicron spike proteins compared to the D614G spike.These substitutions may confer greater sensitivity to low pH-induced conformational changes in endosomes, and therefore be better adapted for entry in the low pH environment encountered in the upper airway 6.In this regard, a recent preprint showed greater sensitivity of Omicron (BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4) pseudoviruses to endosomal (E64d) entry inhibition compared to pseudoviruses with D614G and Delta VOC spikes, but refractory to Camostat inhibition in Caco-2 cells where both endosomal and TMPRSS2-mediated cell surface entry routes are active 56.This phenotype is accounted for by the N969K S2 substitution in Omicron VOCs 56.However, maximum likelihood fitting models comparing the entry routes of Omicron suggest that Omicron is also efficient in utilizing TMPRSS2 for entry into human nasal epithelial cells 56.Alternatively, the BA.1 spike protein was shown to be less efficiently cleaved at the S1/S2 site compared to wild type and Delta VOC in authentic SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, as well as on virions 6,7,36,55.Efficient cleavage at the S1/S2 site is known to be required for exposure of the S2’ site for TMPRSS2 processing after ACE2 binding.Substitutions proximal to the furin cleavage site (H655Y, N679K and P681H), as well as substitutions in the S2 subunit, may contribute to less efficient TMPRSS2 cleavage of Omicron spike 36.Finally, higher affinities of BA.1 (6-fold) and BA.2 (11-fold) RBD for ACE2 coupled with transitions into the so called two- or three-RBD-up conformations may also contribute to the efficient use of ACE2 48,57.",10

98,"Therapeutic Potential of Nutraceuticals and Dietary Supplements in the Prevention of Viral Diseases: A ReviewNowadays, despite enormous scientific advances, viral diseases remain the leading cause of morbidity worldwide, and their potential to spread is escalating, eventually turning into pandemics.Nutrition can play a major role in supporting the immune system of the body and for the optimal functioning of the cells of the immune system.A healthy diet encompassing vitamins, multi-nutrient supplements, functional foods, nutraceuticals, and probiotics can play a pivotal role in combating several viral invasions in addition to strengthening the immune system.This review provides comprehensive information on diet-based scientific recommendations, evidence, and worldwide case studies in light of the current pandemic and also with a particular focus on virus-induced respiratory tract infections.After reviewing the immune potential of nutraceuticals based on the lab studies and on human studies, it was concluded that bioactive compounds such as nutraceuticals, vitamins, and functional foods (honey, berries, etc.)with proven antiviral efficacy, in addition to pharmaceutical medication or alone as dietary supplements, can prove instrumental in treating a range of virus-induced infections in addition to strengthening the immune system.Milk proteins and peptides can also act as adjuvants for the design of more potent novel antiviral drugs.IntroductionA tremendous rise in virus-induced infections and the associated mortality rate has created the demand to come up with effective and safe antiviral drugs.Drug development in case of viruses is challenging due to the emergence of drug-resistant pathways, a limited number of targets, the rapid evolution of viral genes, and the appearance of new viral strains via mutations.WHO has reported around 22 different viral outbreaks in 2019 alone.From the newly emerged viral diseases like ebola virus (in the Republic of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo), hantavirus (in the Republic of Panama and Argentine Republic), zika virus (in France), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar) to well-known viral diseases like measles (in Madagascar, European Region, Western Pacific Region, Tunisia, Lebanon, and Pacific Island Countries and Areas), and dengue fever (in Jamaica, Reunion, France, Pakistan, the Republic of Sudan, Spain, and Afghanistan), the scenario of a viral outbreak is getting worse day by day.",0
99,"WHO has reported around 22 different viral outbreaks in 2019 alone.From the newly emerged viral diseases like ebola virus (in the Republic of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo), hantavirus (in the Republic of Panama and Argentine Republic), zika virus (in France), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar) to well-known viral diseases like measles (in Madagascar, European Region, Western Pacific Region, Tunisia, Lebanon, and Pacific Island Countries and Areas), and dengue fever (in Jamaica, Reunion, France, Pakistan, the Republic of Sudan, Spain, and Afghanistan), the scenario of a viral outbreak is getting worse day by day.According to WHO, the biorisk reduction is mainly based on the use of the current scientific understanding related to the viral hemorrhagic fevers, zoonotic diseases, and epidemic-prone orthopoxviruses, to develop a direction for the control, treatment, and mitigation of the risk of these viral outbreaks regardless of the source.Symptomatic treatments and immunity boost are the most efficient methods as no specific drug is available for each of the viral diseases.Even though various new antiviral agents have been developed recently, still there are numerous constraints associated with the current antiviral treatments such as efficacy, safety, and high costs.Thus, in this scenario, the nonconventional therapy with vitamins, multi-nutrients, functional foods, nutraceuticals, and prebiotics can play a significant role to combat this rising threat.These agents are not only virucidal in action (inhibit viral replication and protein synthesis) but can also boost the natural immunity and increase the physiological condition of the human body (like replenishing glutathione (GSH) amount and controlling the amount of free radicals in the cells).Thus, it becomes difficult for the viruses to replicate inside the host body and the severity of the symptoms also decreases, which can lead to a low mortality rate and speedy recovery.The natural agents (like probiotics) can directly attach to the viruses in the gut, thus preventing the latter from adhering to the host cell by various mechanisms (steric hindrance, a receptor-specific competitive/non-competitive way, the attachment of other chemical agents to prevent binding, etc.)apart from eliciting an active immune response.The antiviral activity of various natural agents against coronavirus may also be done by the modulation of the immune responses (macrophages, dendritic cells, etc.), generation of cytotoxic (antiviral) chemicals and cells like nitric oxide- (NO-) free radicals, cytotoxic T lymphocytes from CD8+ T lymphocytes, T helper cells from CD4+ T lymphocytes, activation of phagocytosis, proliferation of B lymphocytes, etc..With an increase in age, human body starts to produce a smaller number of T cells due to thymus atrophy, thus making an individual susceptible to lethal infections.Therefore, nutrition can play a significant role in assisting the immune system and in optimizing cell functions, including the cells acting in the immune function of the body.Nutraceuticals serve to functionalize food and boost the idea of diet as daily nourishment in health-related aspects.",1
100,"Therefore, nutrition can play a significant role in assisting the immune system and in optimizing cell functions, including the cells acting in the immune function of the body.Nutraceuticals serve to functionalize food and boost the idea of diet as daily nourishment in health-related aspects.In the present review, the efficacy of nutrients, nutraceuticals, probiotics, milk proteins, and functional foods for modulating immune responses and preventing viral infections/or ameliorating disease severity has been concisely summarized.In the following sections, the use of bioactive compounds in viral mechanisms, particularly SARS and respiratory viruses-related infections, has been discussed, which might help in facilitating preintervention either directly as supplements/enriched foods or in combination with pharmaceutical medication.Nutraceutical Supplements for Viral InfectionsNutraceuticals have antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects, such as resveratrol, quercetin, curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) (as shown in Table 1).The antiviral activities of these nutraceuticals against the group of coronaviruses (like SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19) are mainly based on their anti-inflammatory (the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-beta production and inhibition of the pro-inflammatory cytokines) effect along with their viral replication inhibition property by regulating COVID-19 main protease (Mpro).The viral pathogenesis is controlled, and a symptomatic relief has been provided by these agents.Figure 1 shows a general pictorial representation of the modes of action of the selected nutraceuticals against viruses.Various nutraceuticals having an antiviral potential along with their modes of action have been discussed in the following sections.Compilation of antiviral properties and effects of selected nutraceuticals.Name Virus Mechanism of action Effect   Resveratrol  Influenza virus 1.The active blocking of nucleocytoplasmic translocation of viral ribonucleoproteins in MDCK cells 2.Inhibition of protein kinase C associated mechanism.Inhibition of in-vitro and in-vivo viral Replication and protein expression    Epstein-Barr Virus 1.Inhibition of EBV early antigen induction (through Raji cells), EBV lytic cycle, transcription genes and proteins, Rta, Zta, and diffused early antigen (EAD), EBV immediate-early protein: BRLF1 and BZLF1 promoters, transcription factors NF-kappabeta and AP1.2.Downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins: Mc 1 STAT-3, miR-155, and miR-34a 3.Reduction in ROS production 1.Decrease in papilloma production, virion production 2.Inhibition of viral protein synthesis and transformation in human B-cells    Herpes Simplex Virus 1.Decreased production of early viral protein ICP-4.2.Induce the rapid and sustained release of ROS.3.",2

106,"Turmeric has been already used as a traditional medicine in Indian and Chinese civilization.In recent times, curcumin becomes a compound of interest to the scientists due to its potential medicinal effects.It is a highly pleiotropic molecule and has well-known antitumor, antioxidant, hypoglycemic, wound healing, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and anti-infectious properties and further research is still going on.The molecular docking method demonstrated that curcumin binds to the target receptors, which are involved in virus infection mechanisms like spike glycoprotein-RBD, PD-ACE2, and SARS-CoV-2 protease, thus blocking virus entry and budding.The study also revealed that curcumin could possibly block ACE2 (a cell receptor, which binds to SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein) to suppress novel coronavirus entry to the cell.Direct incubation with curcumin is said to reduce the ability of enveloped viruses to infect the cells as the former binds to viral surface glycoproteins and inhibits their activity.In another study, curcumin administration (50 and 150 mg/kg) via oral gavage in an animal model in vivo reduced influenza A virus (IAV) replication and lung injury.So far, ~300 clinical trials have indicated toward the usefulness of curcumin against cardiovascular, neurological, cancer, liver, metabolic, pulmonary, and inflammatory diseases.Coronavirus-induced ""cytokine storm"" results in a multi-organ failure.Curcumin blocks the necessary regulatory signals that are involved in several pro-inflammatory cytokines expression such as MAPK and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathways.Curcumin prevents inflammation and lung fibrosis by lowering the expression of vital cytokines and chemokines (IFNgamma, MCP-1, IL-6, and IL-10) which are involved in viral infection.Despite several health promoting benefits, unstability and low bioavailability in vivo are the main factors, which limit the use of curcumin for clinical use on a wider scale.However, the use of other curcuminoids (demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin), curcumin derivatives and synthetic curcumin analogs, liposome-encapsulated curcumin, curcumin-loaded apotransferrin nanoparticles, and nanoemulsions have increased cellular uptake, solubility, stability, and biological activity.Epigallocatechin GallateFlavonoids have been proven to be a useful functional medicine against a number of diseases.EGCG is a common catechin flavonoid, which can easily be found in tea and tea products.EGCG and its esters have encompassed several activities like anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, etc.EGCG has reported to be helpful against a variety of viruses such as HSV, HCV, enterovirus (EV), and HIV.",8
107,"EGCG and its esters have encompassed several activities like anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, etc.EGCG has reported to be helpful against a variety of viruses such as HSV, HCV, enterovirus (EV), and HIV.Besides this, a study demonstrated the capability of EGCG to act against influenza virus by blocking the nucleo-cytoplasmic movement of viral ribonucleoproteins in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in a dose-dependent approach.It has been hypothesized that EGCG, a zinc ionophore with substantially lower toxicity, can provide a positive effect similar to chloroquine (CQ) by increasing intracellular Zn2+ concentration, thus mediating its antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2.However, human clinical trials need to be done to support in vitro studies and to establish the efficacy of EGCG.N-Acetyl CysteineN-acetyl cysteine is a prodrug, which is primarily employed as a mucolytic medium and also in the control of acetaminophen poisoning.The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of this compound play an essential role in antiviral activity.Though the mechanism of action of the antiviral activity of NAC is still not fully discovered at a molecular level.However, it has been established that it is not only active against viruses like HIV and other viruses having a similar replication mechanism (which are dependent on nuclear transcription factors for their infectivity) but also against other viruses having a complete different pathogenesis of human diseases.It is a well-known fact that the lack of oxygen in a host cell environment, increased cellular stress due to the absence or less amount of GSH and more free radicals, secretion of inflammatory signal molecules play an important part in the virus pathogenesis, and like a GSH-replenishing prodrug, it helps body to fight against those viruses.PalmitoylethanolamidePalmitoylethanolamide can be procured from the plant as well as animal sources.It is a cannabinoid receptor-inactive endocannabinoids (eCB)-related molecule, which is mainly used in prophylaxis for helping in the prevention of respiratory viral infection.It is recognized for its regulatory activity in cellular and metabolic homeostasis, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-modulating capabilities.Its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties help in promoting an antiviral effect on the different types of viruses, especially common cold and influenza.It has also been used in Spain and Italy under the brand name Normast and in the earlier Czechoslovakia under the brand name Impulsin till 2008 while it is currently known as PeaPure.In the USA, it is sold as Recoclix for inflammatory bowel syndrome.It is also effective against various autoimmune disorders, like inflammatory diseases of the CNS and inflammatory bowel disease.",9
108,"In the USA, it is sold as Recoclix for inflammatory bowel syndrome.It is also effective against various autoimmune disorders, like inflammatory diseases of the CNS and inflammatory bowel disease.An early randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted on 468 healthy adults demonstrated that PEA administration lowered (45.5%) the incidences of headache, fever, and sore throat in comparison to the placebo group (p < 0.05).In a prophylactic trial with 918 participants, sickness days were reduced by a decrease of 40 and 32% after 6 and 8 weeks, respectively, relative to placebo (p < 0.0005).In another trial (901 volunteers) of postoral administration of PEA, a notable decrease in acute respiratory diseases (22.7%) and influenza virus titers was observed to be 34.4% in the placebo group (p < 0.0002).Potential Nutrients for Prevention of Viral InfectionsThere are several natural compounds available, which have shown an antiviral potential in averting or/and debilitating viral diseases or for therapeutic applications.A nutrient-rich diet can lessen the possibility of chronic diseases and helps in making many viral infections less severe.Nutrients collectively comprise highly potent vitamins (vitamins A, D, C, E, B6, and B12), minerals (calcium and magnesium), trace elements (zinc, copper, selenium, etc.), carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and water.These multi-nutrients provide the highest nutritional value for all systems of the body, including bone, cardiovascular, liver, skin, and immune support.Therefore, eating a balanced diet rich in multi-nutrients can improve immunity in addition to maintaining respiratory and pulmonary health.Role of Vitamins in Antiviral ImmunityVitamins brace the immune system of the body at three different levels, i.e., physical barrier (such as mucous membrane and skin), antibody production, and cellular immunity.Vitamins C and E help in strengthening the physical barriers.Vitamins C, D, and E assist immune functions at a cellular level.In addition, vitamin C is involved in antibody production.Table 2, adopted from Wikefeldt, provides a general summary of the common sources of nutrients along with their role in body functions, which have been further discussed in the following sections.Functions of immunity building nutrients in the human body along with their food sources.Nutrient Function Food Sources   Vitamin A Helps in maintaining mucosal lining of the gastro-intestinal and respiratory tract, regulates innate immunity, production, growth and differentiation of antibodies and lymph cells, anti-inflammation vitamin, inhibit apoptosis.Orange and yellow fruits, Citrus fruits, sweet potatoes, carrots, bell pepper, dark green leafy vegetables etc.",10

Martineau et al.performed an RCT on 11,321 different people of 14 countries and noticed that vitamin D intake significantly lowered the instance of respiratory infections in people already having deficiency besides lowering infection risk in those with sufficient levels of vitamin D. Another study demonstrated the use of vitamin D in improving the response to antiviral treatments in patients suffering from HIV and hepatitis C. A study conducted by the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016) showed that elderly patients who were given significantly higher doses of the Vitamin D3 had 40% fewer chances to attain lung infections.Deaths in older people are higher due to infections like bronchitis, pneumonia, and influenza because of their weakened immune function.",12

A study conducted by the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016) showed that elderly patients who were given significantly higher doses of the Vitamin D3 had 40% fewer chances to attain lung infections.Deaths in older people are higher due to infections like bronchitis, pneumonia, and influenza because of their weakened immune function.According to research, vitamin D helps in strengthening the first line of defense with age, thus preventing chronic respiratory infections.About 1,000-4,000 IU of vitamin D/day intake is enough though people with severe deficiency need much higher doses.Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)Vitamin C assists several activities of both innate and adaptive immune system at a cellular level.It gathers in the phagocytic cells of the immune system, like neutrophils, and promotes microbe killing through chemotaxis, phagocytosis, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and finally microbial killing.Vitamin C supplements hold the potential to prevent and cure systemic and respiratory infections by strengthening immune functions and therefore are actively used in hospitals to treat SARS-nCoV-2 infection too.Permissible dose, as suggested by researchers, is up to 1-3 g (one tab by mouth once a day).Prophylactic approaches to prevent infection emphasizes daily dietary intake of vitamin C, which provides enough if not saturating plasma levels (100-200 mg/day).On the other hand, for the treatment of developed infections, a much higher dose (g) is required to recoup for a higher metabolic requirement.A scientific work in 11,306 people comprising 29 studies showed that daily vitamin C supplementation at a dosage level of 1-2 g/day decreased the interval of cold by 14% in children and 8% in adults.Furthermore, intravenous vitamin C when administered with high doses improved symptoms in people suffering from serious infections, viral infections-induced sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).However, at higher doses, vitamin C daily can lower the level of copper in the body, especially in people with a copper deficiency, which can in turn adversely affect immune function.A recent study posted to clinical trials by Peng of Zhongnan Hospital, China stated the conduction of vitamin C infusion treatment for the therapy of serious 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia on 140 patients.Another randomized controlled experiment was recorded lately in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and conducted on Vitamin C and COVID-19 signifying the importance of vitamin C tablets in combination with diammonium glycyrrhizinate enteric-coated capsules in the treatment of novel coronavirus-caused pneumonia.Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection induces a cytokine upsurge, which leads to excessive inflammation and consecutively collateral lung damage and higher mortality.Conclusively, vitamin C infusion, an antioxidant, may be used as a symptomatic supportive treatment to help fight against oxidative stress and inflammation.",13
112,"Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection induces a cytokine upsurge, which leads to excessive inflammation and consecutively collateral lung damage and higher mortality.Conclusively, vitamin C infusion, an antioxidant, may be used as a symptomatic supportive treatment to help fight against oxidative stress and inflammation.A meta-analysis represented that the length of mechanical ventilation was shortened by 14% in the group that received vitamin C infusion.Several trials on humans, animals, and cells have confirmed the antiviral potential of vitamin C. Furthermore, vitamin C has shown promising results in controlled trials, by lowering blood pressure, decreasing bronchoconstriction, improving endothelial function, lowering the incidence of atrial fibrillation, evading pain, shortening the span of colds, and their incidence in physically worn out adults in addition to having potential beneficial effects against pneumonia.Vitamin E (alpha-Tocopherol)Vitamin E is an antioxidant with the potential to regulate the host immune response, and its insufficiency is known to hamper humoral and cell-mediated immunity.A study in elderly patients showed that vitamin E supplementation (200 IU/day) did not have much impact on lower respiratory tract infection but offered a shielding effect on upper respiratory tract infections, in particular common cold.The positive effects of vitamin E supplementation positively affected the medication of chronic hepatitis B observed in a small pilot randomized control trial, where a significantly higher normalization of liver enzymes and hepatitis B virus-DNA negativization were noticed in the vitamin E group.Similiar results were noted in a RCT in pediatrics, wherein vitamin E treatment led to a higher anti-HBe seroconversion and virological response.Although one RCT depicted that neither everyday multivitamin-mineral supplement nor vitamin E (200 mg/day) intake depicted a beneficial result on the occurrence and severity of acute respiratory tract infections in well-nourished adults.On the other hand, vitamin E supplementation showed increased severity and symptoms, illness duration, and activity restriction in the group.Vitamin B ComplexVitamins falling under the B complex group play an important role in the proper functioning of the human body including an improvement in the respiratory function activation of the innate and adaptive immune responses and maintenance of endothelial integrity.The administration of high doses of vitamin B1 or thiamine in patients at early stages of COVID-19 facilitates antibody responses and has the potential of limiting hypoxia.A study on combination of vitamin B2 (riboflavin) and UV light not only reduced the level of SARS-CoV-2 in human blood but also acted against MERS-CoV virus.Vitamin B3 (niacin) acts as a precursor of NAD and NADP, which acts by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) and also possesses immunomodulatory properties.It reduces the inflammation in a patient suffering from a ventilator-induced lung injury.",14

One of the studies conducted in 64 hospitalized children suffering from ALRTI showed that the administration of 30 mg zinc daily lowered the infection duration by ~2 days as compared to the control group.Moreover, long-term zinc intake is considered generally safe for healthy adults (set upper limit, 40 mg).On the contrary, excessive prolonged doses may obstruct the absorption of copper, thus compromising the immune system.Many in vitro and clinical studies signify the effectiveness of zinc in eliciting antiviral activity.Shida demonstrated that zinc had a strong effect on numerous respiratory viral infections by the modulation of the entry of viral particles, replication, fusion, viral protein translation, and its release.In another study, low Zn concentration increased the susceptibility to pneumonia, and subjects having a high serum Zn level (>70 mug/dl) were considered to be at a lower risk of getting pneumonia (p < 0.001), along with lower mortality and disease duration in comparison to the low-zinc group (<70 mug/ml).In addition, serum zinc concentration was reported to be 15% lower in the incidences of community acquired pneumonia.Zinc ions might have an anti-inflammatory activity in pneumonia, thereby minimizing oxidative stress and protecting the lungs against damage in sepsis and systemic inflammation.",16
115,"In addition, serum zinc concentration was reported to be 15% lower in the incidences of community acquired pneumonia.Zinc ions might have an anti-inflammatory activity in pneumonia, thereby minimizing oxidative stress and protecting the lungs against damage in sepsis and systemic inflammation.Zinc deficiency in the murine model of polymicrobial sepsis led to higher NF-kappaB p65 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in lungs, which caused the upregulation of the target genes of TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and ICAM-1.On the other hand, taking zinc supplements produced a protective effect in the lungs in the septic state with the help of the modulation of NF-kappaB and ERK 1/2 by lowering neutrophil infiltration and oxidative damage.The observed study also displayed that zinc stops the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of hepatitis E virus, ultimately affecting its replication.Zinc reportedly inhibits coronavirus RdRp activity as well in vitro and zinc ionophores to restrict coronavirus replication.Even though the antiviral properties of zinc have been well-established in addition to the possible property of CQ/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) acting as a zinc ionophore, the synergistic effects of zinc with any one of these drugs still need to be confirmed.It is being speculated that high intracellular zinc concentration might also cause more proper RdRp obstruction resulting in more hinderance of intracellular SARS-CoV-2 multiplication.CopperCopper aids in the development and differentiation of the cells of the immune system.In vitro studies have also depicted the antiviral properties of copper.Copper can kill various viruses such as HIV-1, bronchitis virus, poliovirus in addition to other enveloped and non-enveloped, and double- and single-stranded DNA and RNA viruses.Virus killing by copper might be mediated through ROS.Intracellular copper has been proven to regulate the influenza virus life cycle while copper-thujaplicin complex inhibits the replication of human influenza viruses.Turnlund et al.studied the impact of prolonged high copper consumption on the immune system function in young men.They concluded that benzylamine oxidase, superoxide dismutase, and plasma ceruloplasmin activity were more in amount when the copper intake was 7.8 mg/day, as compared to an intake of 1.6 mg/day, thus showing an enhancement in the antioxidant level.Though a significant reduction in the percentage of serum IL-2R, circulating neutrophils, and the antibody titer was observed at a higher copper intake (7.8 mg/day) against the Beijing strain of influenza.The literature also illustrated that the exposure of copper to nCoV 229E irreversibly affected the morphology of virus by breaking it into envelope and dispersing surface spikes in addition to destroying the viral genome.",17

117,"It acts as both an anti-inflammatory and a bronchodilator and has been used in a successive manner to clear the airways and make it easier to breathe.Some in vivo and in vitro studies emphasize upon the importance of magnesium supplementation in developing the immune reaction against viral infections.One of the studies showed that reduced concentration of free intracellular Mg2+ is responsible for an impaired expression of receptors of CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells (NKG2D) which in turn affects the cytolytic action against viruses and immune surveillance.Two patients suffering from EBV were given oral supplements of magnesium for 175 days in the form of magnesium threonate and magnesium sulfate, on patients suffering from severe EBV infection.Within 2 days of administration, an increase in NKG2D expression and free [Mg2+] ions was observed in patients along with a decrease in the number of EBV-infected cells.This implies that [Mg2+] ion homeostasis in the body is essential for NKG2D expressed CTLs, NK cells, and gammadelta T cells, which in turn mediate antiviral and antitumor immunity.Multi-Nutrient Supplements for Viral InfectionsThe deficiency of micronutrients in the body weakens the immune system by affecting the adaptive antibody response and T-cell-mediated immune response, subsequently causing a balanced host response dysregulation.Certain trace elements and vitamins support immunity by strengthening epithelial lining as well as cellular and humoral immune responses.Moreover, trace elements and vitamin supplement in various combinations have shown favorable results on the antiviral ability of immune response.In a randomized clinical trial comprising 725 elderly patients, considering the parameters such as humoral response to influenza vaccine, delayed-type hypersensitivity skin response, infectious mortality, and morbidity depicted that adequate zinc supplementation in combination with selenium increased humoral activity post immunization relative to the control group.A study on older adults showed that multi-nutrient supplement comprising a combination of trace elements, such as selenium sulfide and zinc, vitamins like ascorbic acid and beta-carotene, corrected specific nutrient deficiencies within 6 months of administration.Respiratory tract infections were absent in patients who received trace elements.In addition, it was observed that the level of antibodies after influenza vaccine administration was higher in groups, which received trace elements alone or were associated with vitamins as compared to the group that received vitamin alone with lower antibody titers.One study conducted on 878 patients suffering from HIV subtype C having a higher cell count than the normal (>350/mul) and underwent antiretroviral therapy revealed that the supplementation of vitamin E plus selenium, vitamin B complex, and vitamin C helped in slowing down the disease progression in addition to lowering the morbidity.Role of Milk Proteins and Peptides in Antiviral ImmunityProtein imbalance in the diet leads to malnutrition resulting in impaired immunity, particularly affecting the T-cell system, leading to increased opportunistic infections and mortality in hospitalized patients.Active milk proteins and peptides possess antiviral and immune regulating characteristics.",19

GG, ATCC 53103) is completely safe for consumption even by premature infants, indicating the potential of probiotics as a relatively safer option for therapy-based intervention in any age group.",23

124,"Probiotics depict the ability to regulate and modulate the immune system.Some probiotic strains have shown an effective antiviral activity including respiratory viruses.However, the mechanism of action against viruses differs from one probiotic strain to another.Probiotics for Upper Respiratory Tract Infections: Clinical StudiesThe role of probiotics in preventing upper respiratory infections (URIs) has been extensively studied.A specific interaction of probiotics with pathogens can potentially reduce their colonization in the nasopharynx, hence reducing URI and acute otitis media (AOM).The microbiota of an individual could be studied and integrated into healthcare to target his specific diseases for a better treatment.Yogurt consumption consisting of Lactobacillus delbrueckiis sp.bulgaricus OLL1073R-1 (R-1) triggered the activity of NK cell and probability of getting a common cold in the elderly was reduced.Similar studies demonstrated the significance of secreted polysaccharides of R-1 in improving immune functions along with NK cell activation.Thus, R-1 or its products might play a role in preventing virus-induced respiratory infections.In another study, it was found that intranasal inoculation of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum or Lactiplantibacillus reuteri guarded against lethal infection caused by pneumonia virus in mice.Furthermore, probiotics along with prebiotics have proven their efficacy in increasing immunogenicity by affecting seroprotection and seroconversion rates in the elderly administered with influenza vaccine.Therefore, a vitamin-probiotic combination could act as a possible immunity booster in a generic manner.For example, vitamin D can modulate an adaptive and innate immune system as the vitamin D receptor is expressed on the surface of all immune cells and also all immunologic cells can produce a vitamin D metabolite.ConclusionFor new viral diseases, no specific pharmacological treatment for their prevention or treatment can be made available immediately.In this regard, research focuses on strengthening the immune system by adopting nutritional strategies.This review aims to put forward the therapeutic and preventive potential of some nutrients, nutraceuticals, trace elements, milk proteins, peptides, functional foods, and probiotics.Further, an awareness about the use of nutrient fortified cereals and grains, nutraceutical products should be created as a part of disease preventive and health promotive approach.In view of the current pandemic of COVID-19, a type of severe acute respiratory infection and a deficit of effective targeted antiviral drugs exist thus a symptomatic support therapy is still the approach to be followed.An in-depth knowledge of the regulatory molecules involved in the molecular mechanism of epigenetic interaction and replication can promote the development of functional food products having an antiviral and immunity potential as a component of the effective therapeutic strategy.",26

130,"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on glycemic control in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review.BACKGROUND: In 2019, a new virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged.Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was classified as a pandemic in a short period of time.In order to reduce the spread of COVID-19, many countries have imposed a lockdown with movement restrictions, social distancing and home confinement, which has affected routine healthcare activities and everyday life.The aim of this systematic review was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D).METHODS: We systematically identified studies by searching the databases Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, EMBASE, and CINAHL until April 2021.We included n = 33 observational studies of which n = 25 investigated T1D and n = 8 T2D.RESULTS: Overall, we analyzed n = 2881 T1D patients and n = 1823 T2D patients.Glycemic values in patients with T1D improved significantly during lockdown.Overall, n = 18 (72%) T1D studies indicated significant improvements in glycemic outcomes.Meta-analysis revealed a mean difference in HbA1c of - 0.05% (95% CI - 0.31 to 0.21) due to lockdown, and in time in range (TIR) of + 3.75% (95% CI 2.56 to 4.92).Lockdown determined a short-term worsening in glycemic values in patients with T2D.Overall, n = 4 (50%) publications observed deteriorations in glycemic control.Meta-analysis demonstrated a mean difference in HbA1c of + 0.14 (95% CI - 0.13 to 0.40) through the lockdown.Moreover, n = 3 (75%) studies reported a not significant deterioration in body weight.CONCLUSIONS: Glycemic values in people with T1D significantly improved during COVID-19 lockdown, which may be associated with positive changes in self-care and digital diabetes management.In contrast, lockdown rather determined a short-term worsening in glycemic parameters in patients with T2D.Further research is required, particularly into the causes and effective T2D management during lockdown.",0
131,"SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein D614G mutation increases virion spike density and infectivitySARS-CoV-2 variants with spike (S)-protein D614G mutations now predominate globally.We therefore compare the properties of the mutated S protein (SG614) with the original (SD614).We report here pseudoviruses carrying SG614 enter ACE2-expressing cells more efficiently than those with SD614.This increased entry correlates with less S1-domain shedding and higher S-protein incorporation into the virion.Similar results are obtained with virus-like particles produced with SARS-CoV-2 M, N, E, and S proteins.However, D614G does not alter S-protein binding to ACE2 or neutralization sensitivity of pseudoviruses.Thus, D614G may increase infectivity by assembling more functional S protein into the virion.SARS-CoV-2 variants with spike (S)-protein D614G mutations currently predominate globally.Here, Zhang et al.hypothesize that D614G variant may increase infectivity by increasing S protein abundance on the virion since pseudoviruses carrying S-G614 incorporate higher amounts of S protein and enter cells more efficiently than those carrying S-D614.IntroductionUntil late 2019, only six coronaviruses were known to infect humans: HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), HCoV-NL63, CoV-HKU1, and MERS-CoV.A seventh human coronavirus, i.e., SARS-CoV-2 detected in late 2019 is closely related to SARS-CoV-1 that emerged in the winter of 2002/2003.The coronavirus spike (S) protein mediates receptor binding and fusion of the viral and cellular membrane.The S protein extends from the viral membrane and is uniformly distributed as trimers on the virion surface to give the appearance of a crown (corona in Latin).The coronavirus S protein is divided into two domains: S1 and S2.The S1 domain mediates receptor binding and the S2 mediates downstream membrane fusion.The receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a metalloprotease that also serves as the receptor for SARS-CoV-1.A small, independently folded subdomain of S1, described as the receptor-binding domain (RBD), directly binds ACE2 when the virus engages a target cell.",0

137,"We also directly visualized virion S-protein bands by silver staining (Supplementary Fig. 5).Although S2 bands are masked by an MLV protein of a similar size, S1 bands are well separated.Again, the intensity of the S1 band of PVG614 is much stronger than that of PVD614, while the p30 bands are comparable, a result consistent with those observed using the anti-FLAG M2 antibody.SARS-CoV-2 VLPG614 and lung epithelial cell-produced PVG614 also exhibit decreased S1 shedding and increased total virion S proteinSARS-CoV-2 VLPG614 and lung epithelial cell-produced PVG614 also exhibit decreased S1 shedding and increased total virion S protein.a–f PVs produced from NCI-H1299, a lung epithelial cell line (a–c), and VLPs (virus-like particles) produced from HEK293T cells by transfecting M, N, E, and S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (d–f) are analyzed.The S protein is FLAG tagged at both the N- and C-termini.PVs were harvested at 48 h and VLPs at 43 h and purified by pelleting through a 20% sucrose layer.The S protein bands were visualized using the anti-FLAG tag M2 antibody (a, d), p30 band with an anti-p30 antibody (a), and the N protein band using pooled convalescent plasma (d).Representative images of WBs (western blot) performed with n = 4 independently prepared PV (a) or VLP (d) batches are shown.The S1:S2 ratio and the difference in total virion S protein incorporation are presented as mean ± SEM, which were calculated from those four PV WBs (b,c) or four VLP WBs (e,f).The p values by two-sided unpaired Student’s t-test are indicated (b, c, e, f).MLV Maloney murine leukemia virus, PV pseudovirus, FKO furin-cleavage knockout mutant.We then explored whether the properties of SG614 could be observed when PVs were produced from the lung epithelial cells, emulating SARS-CoV-2 infection of the lung.To produce sufficient amount of PVs, we screened transfection efficiencies of several lung and gastrointestinal epithelial cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 6).Of these, only NCI-H1299 cells were amenable to transfection with low but usable PV yield.Surprisingly, although most SARS-CoV-2 target cells in the lung epithelium in vivo are enriched with furin, these cells had little or no furin activity (Supplementary Fig. 6).We thus cotransfected a small amount of furin during PV production in NCI-H1299 cells.",6
138,"Surprisingly, although most SARS-CoV-2 target cells in the lung epithelium in vivo are enriched with furin, these cells had little or no furin activity (Supplementary Fig. 6).We thus cotransfected a small amount of furin during PV production in NCI-H1299 cells.These PVs exhibited similar phenotypes as those derived from HEK293T cells (Fig. 3a–c).Thus, as with HEK293T cells, PVs made in a lung epithelial cell line more efficiently incorporated functional SG614 compared to SD614.To verify that these observations were not due to properties of retroviral particles, we repeated these studies with virus-like particles (VLPs) composed only of native SARS-CoV-2 proteins, specifically nucleoprotein (N), membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E), and S protein.VLPs were purified and analyzed in the same way as MLV PVs.S-protein bands were detected with the anti-FLAG M2 antibody, and N protein with pooled plasma derived from convalescent COVID-19 patients.As with PVs, the S1:S2 ratio and total S protein on the virion were again much higher in the VLPs carrying SG614 (VLPG614) compared to those carrying SD614 (VLPD614) (Fig. 3d–f).Thus, enhanced entry of PV containing the D614G mutation correlates with reduced shedding of the S1 domain and greater incorporation of functional spikes into the virion.To exclude an artifact associated with S-protein tags, we similarly characterized untagged S proteins (Supplementary Fig. 7).Again greater virion incorporation of S protein and higher ratios of S1 to S2 were observed with PVG614 compared with PVD614.We next asked if higher stability of PVG614 spikes correlated with slower loss of PV infectivity over time.PVs left at room temperature for up to 48 h were used in hACE2-293T entry assays.Under these conditions, we observed no difference in the rate of inactivation among PVD614, PVG614, or PVFKO (Supplementary Fig.8a), indicating that loss of infectivity by these PVs is attributed to factors other than differences in their S proteins.This unexpected result suggested the possibility that most S1-domain shedding from SD614 occurs before the test period.To evaluate this possibility, we purified PVs from intracellular compartments and observed that S1 shedding had already taken place (Supplementary Fig. 8b).",7

140,"FKO furin-cleavage knockout mutant.It has previously been speculated that D614G mutation promotes an open configuration of the S protein that is more favorable to ACE2 association.To explore this possibility, we investigated whether ACE2 binding to SG614-spikes, S-protein trimers, was more efficient than to SD614-spikes.HEK293T cells transfected to express each of these S proteins were assessed for their binding of hACE2 immunoadhesin, whose enzymatic activity was abolished by mutation (hACE2-NN-Ig).We previously showed hACE2-NN-Ig bound SARS-CoV-1 RBD with an equivalent affinity as hACE2-Ig.The S proteins used in this study are fused to the FLAG tag at the C-terminus, but not at the N-terminus, thus allowing for the measurement of total S protein expression with an anti-FLAG antibody.As Supplementary Fig.9a shows, total expression of SD614, SG614, and SFKO, assessed by FLAG-tag staining of permeabilized cells, was comparable.However, hACE2-NN-Ig binding to cells expressing SG614- and SFKO-spikes was substantially higher than that to cells expressing SD614-spikes (Fig.4a and Supplementary Fig. 9a).There are several explanations for this observation.First, SG614 increased ACE2 association by promoting an open configuration of the RBD that was suggested more favorable to ACE2 binding.Second, this mutation actually increased S1 affinity to ACE2, although the residue 614 was outside of the RBD.Third, SG614 increased total ACE2 binding by reducing S1-domain shedding.To differentiate these possibilities, we appended the Myc-tag to the N-terminus of the S-proteins that are FLAG tagged at its C-terminus and repeated the experiment, this time detecting the S1 domain using an anti-Myc antibody.As Supplementary Fig.9b shows, while total expression of SD614, SG614, and SFKO, assessed by FLAG-tag staining of permeabilized cells, is similar, the levels of SG614- and SFKO-spikes on the cell surface, measured by an anti-Myc antibody, were considerably higher than that of SD614-spikes.In fact, the ratio of Myc tag to FLAG tag is similar to the ratio of hACE2-binding to FLAG tag (Fig.4a, b), indicating that increased ACE2 binding to the SG614-spikes did not result from its increased affinity to SG614 or the open RBD configuration.Instead, these data indicate that a higher number of the S1 domain is present on the surface of SG614-expressing cells.To confirm that the monomeric interaction between hACE2 and S protein is not affected by the D614G mutation, we performed surface plasmon resonance assays.",9
141,"Instead, these data indicate that a higher number of the S1 domain is present on the surface of SG614-expressing cells.To confirm that the monomeric interaction between hACE2 and S protein is not affected by the D614G mutation, we performed surface plasmon resonance assays.Soluble monomeric hACE2-NN bound with a nearly identical affinity to S1G614-Fc and S1D614-Fc immobilized on a chip (Fig.4c), a result that is expected because the residue 614 is outside of the RBD.Together, these results indicate that increased ACE2 binding to the cell surface-expressed SG614 spikes is due to decreased S1 shedding.Finally, we assessed whether differential amount of functional S protein on the virion could influence neutralization sensitivity of the virus.Fig.4d shows that PVD614, PVG614, and PVFKO are similarly susceptible to neutralizing plasma derived from convalescent patients, indicating that antibody-mediated control of viruses carrying SD614 and SG614 would be similar, and that the vaccines based on the D614 genotype will still be effective against the virus carrying the D614G mutation.DiscussionOur data make clear that there are consistent differences in the efficiency with which SD614 and SG614 are incorporated into PVs and VLPs.However, the physical basis for these differences remains undefined.The different ratios of S1:S2 suggest that association between these two domains is weaker in SD614.The apparent instability of SD614 could impact the integrity of the local membrane, appropriate trafficking of the S protein, or appropriate post-translational modification of the S-protein cytoplasmic tail, which may in turn impact S-protein incorporation into the virion.Our data also make clear that both a functional proprotein convertase and a functional furin-cleavage motif are necessary to observe differences between SD614 and SG614.Although evidence is still accumulating, the increasing predominance of D614G in humans raises the possibility that viruses with this mutation have a fitness advantage, perhaps allowing more efficient person-to-person transmission.Our virological data are consistent with, but do not themselves demonstrate, this hypothesis.Interestingly, this mutation does not appear to significantly impact disease severity.It is possible that higher levels of functional S protein observed with PVG614 increase the chance of host-to-host transmission, but other factors limit the rate and efficiency of intra-host replication.Alternatively, the loss of virion-associated S proteins observed with SD614 may be compensated by greater fusion efficiency with the destabilized S protein when the next target cell is adjacent in a host tissue.It is also possible that our ability to detect the emergence of new mutations at this stage of the pandemic is simply greater than our ability to detect modest differences in pathogenesis.",10
142,"Alternatively, the loss of virion-associated S proteins observed with SD614 may be compensated by greater fusion efficiency with the destabilized S protein when the next target cell is adjacent in a host tissue.It is also possible that our ability to detect the emergence of new mutations at this stage of the pandemic is simply greater than our ability to detect modest differences in pathogenesis.The strong phenotypic difference we observe here between D614 and G614 suggests that more studies on the impact of the D614G mutation on the course of disease may be warranted.Finally, our data raise interesting questions about the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 as it moved presumably from horseshoe bats to humans.At some point in this process, the virus acquired a furin-cleavage site, allowing its S1/S2 boundary to be cleaved in virus-producing cells.In contrast, the S1/S2 boundary of SARS-CoV-1, and indeed all SARS-like viruses isolated from bats, civet cats, and pangolins lack this polybasic site and are instead cleaved by TMPRSS2 or endosomal cathepsins in the target cells.As we have shown in this study, there are two mechanisms with which SARS-CoV-2 could have enhanced its infectivity, namely, through D614G mutation or elimination of furin-cleavage site with an optimized replacement (Supplementary Fig. 2).However, as the virus transmits in humans, it has clearly retained the furin site while compensating for this site with D614G mutation.Therefore, the furin-cleavage site itself appears to confer a yet-to-be-determined fitness advantage.In summary, an S-protein mutation, D614G, that appears to promote SARS-CoV-2 transmission in humans also enhances functional S-protein incorporation into SARS-CoV-2 VLP and retroviral PV and increases PV infectivity.Further studies will be necessary to determine the impact of this change on the nature and severity of COVID-19.MethodsSARS-CoV-2 S protein sequences analysisTo track the D614G variation among SARS-CoV-2 isolates, S protein sequences were downloaded from GenBank by searching for “SARS-CoV-2 spike” and by filtering the result based on sequence length “1272–1273” to retrieve full-length S protein.To separate retrieved sequences by the month, the result was further filtered by release date.Genotype frequency at residue 614 was calculated using R version 3.6.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) with the Biostrings package version 2.52.Logo plots of D614G variation were generated by WebLogo version 3 after sequence alignment.",11

156,"INO-4800 DNA vaccine induces neutralizing antibodies and T cell activity against global SARS-CoV-2 variantsGlobal surveillance has identified emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) associated with broadened host specificity, pathogenicity, and immune evasion to vaccine-induced immunity.Here we compared humoral and cellular responses against SARS-CoV-2 VOC in subjects immunized with the DNA vaccine, INO-4800.INO-4800 vaccination induced neutralizing antibodies against all variants tested, with reduced levels detected against B.1.351.IFNγ T cell responses were fully maintained against all variants tested.Main textSARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, continues to cause unprecedented levels of mortality and socioeconomic burden.Concerningly, virus surveillance shows the global spread of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants, which are more infectious and display increased transmissibility and pathology.Some of these variants of concern (VOC) contain mutations in the Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), the region which interacts with the host ACE2 receptor, and to which many SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies target.The B.1.1.7 lineage, the first emerging VOC, contains the key N501Y and D614G mutations and the 69–70 deletion in the RBD and/or S1 regions and exhibits increased transmissibility, but does not appear to significantly evade neutralizing antibody responses generated by current vaccines approved for use.The B.1.351 and P.1 lineages have additional mutations, including E484K in the RBD region, as well as unique changes in position K417.Notably, sera isolated from convalescent individuals and vaccinees exposed to the original Wuhan Spike protein sequence have shown significantly lower levels of neutralizing activity against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants.INO-4800 is a SARS-CoV-2 Spike DNA-based vaccine that is delivered intradermally followed by electroporation (EP) using CELLECTRA® 2000 and is currently undergoing clinical development.In Phase 1 clinical trial, INO-4800 vaccination induced a balanced immune response characterized by both functional antibody and T cell responses in vaccinated subjects.Both humoral and cellular immune responses have been shown to be important components of protection against betacoronaviruses.In the present study, we have assessed the humoral and T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants elicited after INO-4800 vaccination (Supplementary Fig.",0

158,"The mean ID50 titers for the Wuhan, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1.were 643, 295, 105, and 664, respectively (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).Compared to Wuhan, there was a 2.1 and 6.9-fold reduction for B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, respectively, while there was no difference between Wuhan and the P.1 variant.These results are consistent with other recent studies, which have demonstrated a significant reduction in neutralizing activity in vaccinated individuals towards the B.1.351 (≥6-fold reduction), while the B.1.1.7 lineage has demonstrated a reduced activity of two-fold or less.Strikingly, while the P.1 strain presents with similar RBD mutations as B.1.351, we did not observe any reduction in neutralizing activity compared to the Wuhan strain in INO-4800 vaccinated individuals.The P.1 lineage has similar changes in the RBD to the B.1.351 lineage as they contain the N501Y mutation found in the B.1.1.7 lineage and identical E484K mutations.However, they have similar but different mutations at position K417, with a change to T for the P.1 and to N for the B.1.351 lineage.While both are changes to polar uncharged side chains, the B.1.351 N mutation carries an additional amino group.It is possible that this position and this change allow for the impact of neutralizing responses observed.In addition, since P.1 and B.1.351 have almost identical RBD mutations, changes outside the RBD may play a role in neutralization, especially in the N-terminal domain (NTD), where a large number of mutations have accumulated in the P.1 and B.1.351 variants.However, B.1.351 variant contains unique deletions in the NTD region that is a known epitope for potent neutralizing antibodies.The P.1 variant, while having similar RBD changes relative to B.1.351, it does not have said deletions in the NTD.INO-4800 cellular immune response against SARS-CoV-2 variants.PBMCs from 10 Phase 1 subjects were collected 8 weeks after receiving the second dose of INO-4800 (n = 5, 1.0 mg; n = 5, 2.0 mg).PBMCs were treated with peptide pools spanning the entire Spike proteins of the Wuhan, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, or P.1 variants, and cellular responses were measured by IFNγ ELISpot assay.Mean ± s.e.m.",2

160,"Recent studies have shown a dramatic reduction in serum neutralization levels against B.1.351, a 2 to 4-fold reduction against P.1, and a minimal impact against B.1.1.7.In addition, vaccine trials have shown a considerable reduction in protective efficacy against B.1.351.Interestingly, a small reduction in protective efficacy is observed in Latin American countries including Brazil, suggesting that P.1 may have emerged around the time of clinical trials were in effect.Here we report the neutralizing antibody and T cell activity measured in INO-4800 vaccinated subjects against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants first detected in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil.The neutralization levels against B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 for the INO-4800 SARS-CoV-2 Spike DNA vaccine are consistent with previous reports of subjects receiving vaccines encoding for the ancestral Spike protein.We also showed that INO-4800 generates robust neutralizing antibodies against P.1 at levels comparable to the Wuhan strain.Despite similarities in the RBD of P.1 and B.1.351, studies have reported a reduced impact in neutralization against P.1, compared to B.1.351.In sera from individuals who received the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 or the BNT162b2 vaccines, there was a 2.8 and 2.2-fold reduction in neutralization against P.1, compared to 8.6 and 6.5-fold for B.1.351, respectively.The lower resistance to neutralization conferred by the P.1 variant suggests that changes outside the RBD, especially in the NTD, where P.1 and B.1.351 acquired and accumulated different mutations, may play a role in neutralization.INO-4800 induces cross-reactive T cell responses against B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants that are comparable to the Wuhan strain.Taken together, these data demonstrate maintenance of one or both cellular and humoral arms of the immune response against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants for the INO-4800 vaccine, which will likely be critical factors to impact the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsClinical trial subject samplesSerum and PBMC samples were acquired from participants of the phase I INO-4800 clinical trial (NCT04336410) described previously.The trial has since been expanded to include participants of 51−64 and 64+ years of age as separate groups in addition to the original 18–50 age group.A 0.5 mg dose group was also added.The institutional review board of each clinical site approved the trial.All trial participants provided written informed consent.",4

169,"Infection-enhancing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies recognize both the original Wuhan/D614G strain and Delta variants.A potential risk for mass vaccination?Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection is a safety concern for vaccine strategies.In a recent publication, Li et al.(Cell 184 :4203-4219, 2021) have reported that infection-enhancing antibodies directed against the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein facilitate virus infection in vitro, but not in vivo.However, this study was performed with the original Wuhan/D614G strain.Since the Covid-19 pandemic is now dominated with Delta variants, we analyzed the interaction of facilitating antibodies with the NTD of these variants.Using molecular modeling approaches, we show that enhancing antibodies have a higher affinity for Delta variants than for Wuhan/D614G NTDs.We show that enhancing antibodies reinforce the binding of the spike trimer to the host cell membrane by clamping the NTD to lipid raft microdomains.This stabilizing mechanism may facilitate the conformational change that induces the demasking of the receptor binding domain.As the NTD is also targeted by neutralizing antibodies, our data suggest that the balance between neutralizing and facilitating antibodies in vaccinated individuals is in favor of neutralization for the original Wuhan/D614G strain.However, in the case of the Delta variant, neutralizing antibodies have a decreased affinity for the spike protein, whereas facilitating antibodies display a strikingly increased affinity.Thus, ADE may be a concern for people receiving vaccines based on the original Wuhan strain spike sequence (either mRNA or viral vectors).Under these circumstances, second generation vaccines with spike protein formulations lacking structurally-conserved ADE-related epitopes should be considered.",0
170,"Effectiveness of the BNT162b2 Covid-19 Vaccine against the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 VariantsTo The Editor: The messenger RNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) has 95% efficacy against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).Qatar launched a mass immunization campaign with this vaccine on December 21, 2020.As of March 31, 2021, a total of 385,853 persons had received at least one vaccine dose and 265,410 had completed the two doses.Vaccination scale-up occurred as Qatar was undergoing its second and third waves of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which were triggered by expansion of the B.1.1.7 variant (starting in mid-January 2021) and the B.1.351 variant (starting in mid-February 2021).The B.1.1.7 wave peaked during the first week of March, and the rapid expansion of B.1.351 started in mid-March and continues to the present day.Viral genome sequencing conducted from February 23 through March 18 indicated that 50.0% of cases of Covid-19 in Qatar were caused by B.1.351 and 44.5% were caused by B.1.1.7.Nearly all cases in which virus was sequenced after March 7 were caused by either B.1.351 or B.1.1.7.Data on vaccinations, polymerase-chain-reaction testing, and clinical characteristics were extracted from the national, federated Covid-19 databases that have captured all SARS-CoV-2–related data since the start of the epidemic (Section S1 of the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org).Vaccine effectiveness was estimated with a test-negative case–control study design, a preferred design for assessing vaccine effectiveness against influenza (see the Supplementary Appendix).A key strength of this design is the ability to control for bias that may result from differences in health care–seeking behavior between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons.The estimated effectiveness of the vaccine against any documented infection with the B.1.1.7 variant was 89.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 85.9 to 92.3) at 14 or more days after the second dose (Table 1 and Table S2).",0

180,"A study demonstrated that viral mRNA uses eIF4A for synthesis of its protein (Montero et al.).Genomic mRNAs of SARS-CoV-2 have a 5-cap structure and go through cap-dependent translation via eIF4F.The eIF4A is a part of eIF4F protein complex which is associated with other two translation initiation factors such as eIF4E and eIF4G, in turn connected with eIF4A which is further connected with eIF4E (Nakagawa et al.).In the cap-dependent mechanism of translation, the viral mRNA is engaged with eIF4F protein complex, consisted of three functional proteins: eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF4G.The eIF4A and eIF4F are essential for recruitment of ribosomes for protein synthesis during SARS-CoV-2 infection.Consequently, eIF4A is important for controlling translation and regulating gene expression at the translational level (Montero et al.).Mechanism of nucleocapsid inhibitor and eiF4A inhibitor.Inhibition of eIF4A with synthetic or natural antiviral drugs prevents replication and translation in SARS-CoV-2.Pateamine A and silvestrol irreversibly bind with eiF4A and inhibit the binding of eiF4A with mRNA.On the other hand, nucleocapsid block the phosphorylation of IRF3 which in turn cause transcription of INF, H3, and PJ34 which are inhibitors of nucleocapsid.These inhibitors reduced the N protein's binding affinity with IRF3, which leads to the activation of INF and hindered viral replication.Abbreviations: IRF-3, interferon regulatory factor-3; eiF4A, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 A; NF-kB, nuclear factor kappa B; INF, interferon; TBK1, TANK-binding kinaseRecently, research has revealed that specific inhibition of eIF4A can block viral replication and thus help the immune system for establishing an effective antiviral response.Inhibition of eIF4A with synthetic or natural antiviral drugs shows similar inhibition of replication and translation in SARS-CoV-2.Similarly, natural compounds like silvestrol and rocaglamide have been reported as a precise inhibitor of eIF4A in viral translation using virus-infected primary cells (Fig.5).It is also revealed to retain an inhibitory activity toward Ebola virus in viral-infected human macrophages (Nebigil et al.).Additionally, another study conducted using human embryonic lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cells infected with CoVs has demonstrated that inhibits eIF4A by silvestrol leads to separation of cap-dependent viral mRNA translation.Silvestrol has been shown protection against MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E with EC50 = 1.3 nM and 3 nM respectively (Song et al.,).",6

185,"Thus, N protein acts as a beta interferon (IF-beta) antagonist.The mechanism behind the inhibition of IF-beta synthesis by N protein might be due to blockage of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) (Frieman and Baric,).Both IRF-3 and NF-kB are important transcription factors, essential for interferon gene expression.So, inhibition of the interferon response is liable to contribute to the SARS-CoV pathogenesis (DeDiego et al.).Therefore, N protein of SARS-CoV-2 is involved during viral infection and inhibition of N protein may be useful to combat viral infection.The new molecules synthesized such as N protein inhibitors prevent the interaction between RNA and N protein, resulting in inhibition of viral replication during infection (Prajapat et al.).Likewise, in silico virtual study developed compound H3 as a blocker for SARS-CoV-2 NPs which has been further verified by X-ray crystallography (Zhou et al.).Moreover, N-(6-oxo-5, 6-dihydro phenanthridin-2-yl) (N, N-dimethyl amino) acetamide hydro-chloride (PJ34) is another N protein inhibitor which has been developed using virtual screening.This inhibitor decreased the binding capacity of N proteins with RNA and precluded replication of virus (Wang et al.).Consequently, the discovery of novel NP-targeting agents is very beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19 infections.Envelope proteinThe envelope protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a short, chief viral structural protein containing 76 to 109 amino acids (Kuo et al.).Moreover, the primary and secondary structure confirms that E protein, having a short hydrophilic amino terminus, exposed in the membrane toward the cytoplasmic side which consisted of 7-12 amino acids along with large hydrophobic transmembrane cytoplasmic domain consisted of 25 amino acids (Li et al.).The hydrophobic region of the transmembrane domain contains at least one predicted amphipathic alpha-helix which upon oligomerizes form an ion-conductive pore in membrane (Torres et al.).Studies revealed that E protein contains a binding motif known as the postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95)/Drosophila disk large tumor suppressor (Dlg1)/(PDZ)-binding motif (PBM), which are located at the last four amino acids of carboxyl terminus (Teoh et al.).The PDZ domain is a protein-protein interaction unit that binds with carboxyl terminus of target proteins, involved in the viral infection (Hung and Sheng,).",11
186,"Studies revealed that E protein contains a binding motif known as the postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95)/Drosophila disk large tumor suppressor (Dlg1)/(PDZ)-binding motif (PBM), which are located at the last four amino acids of carboxyl terminus (Teoh et al.).The PDZ domain is a protein-protein interaction unit that binds with carboxyl terminus of target proteins, involved in the viral infection (Hung and Sheng,).Some interaction partners are capable to binding with PBM of E protein and are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 (Jimenez-Guardeno et al.,).Despite its enigmatic nature, several studies are conducted to date to demonstrate the function of E protein.The interaction between the cytoplasmic units of the E and M protein drives VLP production suggesting that E protein participates in viral assembly, release of virions, and crucial to the pathogenesis of the virus (Hogue and Machamer,; Ye and Hogue,).The E protein is also involved in maintaining the morphogenesis and phenotype of virus.This phenotype suggests that E protein is essential for creating the membrane curvature, which is necessary to acquire the rounded and stable virions.Similar to other viruses, the E protein of SARS-CoV-2 was shown to form membrane channels with selectivity for monovalent cations along with enhanced the membrane permeability of bacterial and mammalian cells (Madan et al.).This channel-forming activity of SARS-CoV-2 E protein was recently comprehensive to the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), MHV, and IBV (Wilson et al.).More interestingly, the channels formed by E proteins show greater preference for sodium ions (Na+2) over potassium ions (K+2), but in contrast, the ion channels formed by the E protein of coronavirus HCoV-229E exhibit greater preference for potassium ions (K+2) over sodium ions (Na+2) (Wilson et al.).Hexamethylene amiloride (HMA) is an amiloride analog which blocks the ion channel activity of HIV, HCV, and dengue virus (Ewart et al.).This molecule could also inhibit the ion channel activity of the HCoV-229E, suggesting a more divergent structure of coronavirus E protein.Furthermore, HMA is also able to inhibit the replication of HCoV-229E along with MHV, but not the replication of a recombinant MHV with deletion of the entire E gene (Wilson et al.).These results indicate that the ion channel activity of coronavirus E protein is important for virus replication.Spike protein and ACE2After immense research work, the researchers now revealed that COVID-19 is an enveloped virus.",12

188,"The S-protein binds with ACE2 by fusing with plasma membrane and releases RNA genome.This leads to replication and initiates exocytosis thereby releases number of virus species inside the host alveolar cells (Fig.6).Increased prevalence of COVID-19 is also implicated for viral entry and modulation of the rennin angiotensin mechanism, which is propagated by the downregulation of ACE2 expression on the plasma membrane arising from infection with SARS-CoV-2 (Robson,).In many models of lung injury, ACE2 has been publicized to be pneumoprotective because of its impact on angiotensin II degradation (Sparks et al.).During the infection with SARS-CoV-2, the production of ACE2, downregulation the SARS-CoV-2 receptors, on the surface of cells.The cause of this downregulation seems to be attributed due to internalization of ACE2 after the initiation of SARS-CoV-2 (Perrotta et al.)and the activation of TNFalpha or metalloproteases of Adams family.Because they cleave the extracellular ACE2 domain from the trans-membranous domain sheds into the media (Gheblawi et al.).ACE2 shows pneumoprotective impact on acute lung damage triggered by acid damage (Kuba et al.)and addition of a recombinant fusion protein comprising of SARS S protein (Hamming et al.).These findings concluded that SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to receptor of the host cell and activates the membrane fusion process of virus that take part in virus invasion process.The SARS-CoV-2 is replicated in myocardium whereas pulmonary inflammation is correlated with ACE2 (Hamming et al.).Several proteases, including cathepsin L, have been reported to affect SARS-CoV-2 entry through cleavage of the S-protein and activation of its membrane fusion activity (Simmons et al.).Several types of vaccinations and antiviral drugs, based on S protein, have been evaluated.A study has shown that vaccines can be grounded on the S proteins consisted of full-length S protein, viral vector, DNA, recombinant S protein, and recombinant RBD protein (Kaur and Gupta,).In vitro analysis of S-based antiviral treatments is comprised of RBD-ACE2 blockers, S cleavage inhibitors, fusion center inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, protease inhibitors, S-protein inhibitors, and minor interfering RNAs (Cannalire et al.).There are some recombinant complexes such as IFN with ribavirin known to partially reduce COVID-19 infection.Monoclonal antibodies mainly target the S1 subunit and fusion inhibitors bind to S2 subunit, which could be effective therapeutic target for the treatment of COVID-19 infections (Millet and Whittaker,).",14

192,"The polymerase RdRp domain is located on the C-terminus and a retained amino acid sequence of Ser-Asp-Asp (Baez-Santos et al.,).RdRp also acts as therapeutic target due to important role in replication of the RNA genome.Furthermore, there is absence of counterpart to RdRp in mammalian cells, and inhibition of this does not cause target-related side effects (Tian et al.).Pharmaceutical companies are still looking to develop effective RdRp inhibitors and block viral replication.There are two known classes of RdRp inhibitors: nucleoside analog inhibitors (NIs) and non-nucleoside analog inhibitors (NNIs) are used for treatments of virus infections (Tian et al.).The well-known RdRp inhibitors are nucleoside analogs such as favipiravir, ribavirin, penciclovir, remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, EIDD-2801, and galidesivir which are under investigation for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Remdesivir is a prodrug of an adenosine nucleotide analog, which is under the clinical trial phase III for COVID-19 treatments.Based on clinical trial data, remdesivir got emergency use permit in the United States (US) on May 1, 2020, and a special approval for emergency use in Japan on May 7, 2020 (Lamb,) and in Taiwan in late May 2020 with safety ensure.Favipiravir is an antiviral drug that selectively and potently inhibits the RdRp of RNA viruses.It undergoes intracellular phosphoribosylation into favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5'-triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP) (Furuta et al.).Active favipiravir-RTP acts as a nascent RNA strand elongation terminator by competing with purine nucleosides for RdRp binding (Sangawa et al.).Some comparative study has found that favipiravir exerts more powerful antiviral activity against COVID-19 due to faster viral clearance and a higher improvement rate in chest imaging than lopinavir/ritonavir-treated patients (Furuta et al.).Ribavirin show antiviral activity against a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses.Due to broad-spectrum antiviral efficacy of ribavirin, used as an antiviral therapy during the outbreaks of extreme SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2012 (Stockman et al.; Momattin et al.).The National Health Commission of China recommended intravenous infusion of ribavirin (500 mg) in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir or interferon in the most recent COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment plan (Wang et al.).List of potential therapeutic drugs for COVID-19.",18

208,"Why do SARS-CoV-2 NSPs rush to the ER?SARS-CoV-2, which led to the 2020 global pandemic, is responsible for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory illness, and presents a tropism for the central nervous system.Like most members of this family, the virus is composed of structural and non-structural proteins (NSPs).The non-structural proteins are critical elements of the replication and transcription complex (RTC), as well as immune system evasion.Through hijacking the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, NSPs help the virus establish the RTC, inducing ER stress after membrane rearrangement and causing severe neuronal disturbance.In this review, we focus on the role of Nsp3, 4, and 6 in intracellular membrane rearrangement and evaluate the potential disruption of the central nervous system and the neurodegeneration which it could trigger.Studies of these NSPs will not only bring to light their specific role in viral infection but also facilitate the discovery of novel targeted drugs.BackgroundSince the discovery of the first coronaviruses (CoV) by Tyrrell and Bynoe in 1965, more strains have emerged.Only two circulating human coronaviruses (HCoVs), HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, were described as the frequent cause of the common cold until 2002–2003 when the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV spread into the human population in China.Then, two new coronaviruses, CoV NL63 in 2004 (alphacoronavirus) and HKU1 in 2005 (betacoronavirus), were discovered.Another coronavirus, the MERS-CoV, emerged in the Middle East and engenders lower respiratory tract infections with high mortality.HCoVs were considered relatively harmless until the SARS outbreak in 2003, where they appeared clinically for the first time as a severe respiratory illness with high mortality and morbidity.Coronaviruses have been identified to infect a wide variety of animals, birds, and mammals, including mice, cats, bats, dogs, pangolins, as well as humans, with a diversity of clinical presentation including respiratory tract infection and gastroenteritis.The outbreaks of SARS and MERS and the frequent re-introduction of coronaviruses in the human population increased the awareness of the danger of emergence of other zoonotic coronaviral infections.These epidemics indicate the need to develop antiviral compounds to combat coronavirus infections.",0
209,"The outbreaks of SARS and MERS and the frequent re-introduction of coronaviruses in the human population increased the awareness of the danger of emergence of other zoonotic coronaviral infections.These epidemics indicate the need to develop antiviral compounds to combat coronavirus infections.However, gaps still exist in the knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis and transmissivity of this family of viruses.CoVs belong to the Nidovirales order—Coronaviridae family—and received their names from the unique “crown-like” spikes that are visible on the outer membrane of the virions.Coronaviruses are large enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses that are broken down into four classes: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Deltacoronavirus.Coronaviruses are the largest RNA viruses known with a genome ranging between 27 and 32 kb.Like all the Nidovirales members, Coronaviruses have a highly conserved genomic organization, unique enzymatic activities, and express non-structural genes by ribosomal frameshifting.Viral replication and structureStructure of SARS-CoV-2.Schematic representation of SARS-CoV-2 structure where all the open reading frames (Orfs) and non-structural proteins (NSPs) positions are indicated.Cleavage sites processed by the papain-like proteinase are indicated by blue arrowheads and the 3C-like proteinase are indicated by red arrowheadsSARS-CoV-2 contains a 30 kb genome encoding 14 open reading frames (Orfs) where each encodes several proteins (structural and non-structural) (Fig. 1).The first non-structural proteins (NSPs) encoded by Orf1a/Orf1ab are Papain-like proteinase (PL proteinase, Nps3) and 3-chymotrypsin-like proteinase (3CLPro protease).The PL proteinase Nsp3 cleaves NSPs 1 to 3 and the 3CLPro proteinase slices the C-terminus from Nsp4 to Nsp16 in all coronaviruses.Orf1a gene is expressed early and translated into a polyprotein that will be cleaved into 11 non-structural proteins (Nsp1-11) by the papain-like activity of Nsp3 or by Nsp5, which possess a chymotrypsin-like protease activity.Orf1ab is in a different frame from Orf1a and the virus uses programmed-1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) to synthesize it.Replication and transcription of the virus happen within a replication/transcription complex (RTC) encoded by the virus with NSPs as primary constituents.Nearly all RTC elements are encoded by the large replicase gene that consists of Orf1a and Orf1ab.",1
210,"Orf1ab is in a different frame from Orf1a and the virus uses programmed-1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) to synthesize it.Replication and transcription of the virus happen within a replication/transcription complex (RTC) encoded by the virus with NSPs as primary constituents.Nearly all RTC elements are encoded by the large replicase gene that consists of Orf1a and Orf1ab.The early formation of the RTC is an essential step in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle to safeguard viral genome replication and to synthesize subgenomic mRNA.The RTC comprises multiple proteins; the non-structural proteins Nsp3, Nsp4, and Nsp6 that participate in the formation of sites for viral RNA synthesis, the principal protease (Nsp5), the Nsp7–Nsp8 primase complex, the main RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Nsp12), the helicase/triphosphatase (Nsp13), the exoribonuclease (Nsp14), the endonuclease (Nsp15), and the N7- and 2′O- methyltransferases (Nsp10/Nsp16).The replicase-transcriptase proteins are expected to be great targets for anti-coronaviral drugs.Nsp3 is the largest element of the RTC.In addition to cleaving, Nsp3 alters cytokine expression to decrease the host innate immune response.Nsp5 is a 3CLPro protease crucial for RNA replication.Nsp3, Nsp4, and Nsp6 form a complex to induce double-membrane vesicles.Nsp7 and Nsp8 form an RNA polymerase complex performing de novo initiation and primer extension.Nsp8 interacts with the replicase Nsp9, and with the Orf6 accessory protein.In addition, four structural proteins: Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) are encoded at the 3′-end.Eleven Orfs and 8 postulated accessory factors are also part of the virus structure.Formation of double-membrane vesicles by Nsp3-4-6To evade detection by host innate immune sensors, many viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm compartmentalize their genome transcription in organelle-like structures, thus protecting the virus against host cell defenses and increasing the replication efficiency.Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses and, as such, arrogate intracellular membranes of different cellular organelles.The membrane rearrangements can be an invagination towards the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or other organelles, or an extrusion of the ER membrane forming double-membrane vesicles (DMVs).Outer membranes of DMVs interconnect with the ER and other virus-induced structures called convoluted membranes (CM).The ER is probably the main donor for this elaborate Reticulovesicular Network (RVN), but autophagosomes and late endosomes can also be a membrane source of DMVs.",2
211,"Outer membranes of DMVs interconnect with the ER and other virus-induced structures called convoluted membranes (CM).The ER is probably the main donor for this elaborate Reticulovesicular Network (RVN), but autophagosomes and late endosomes can also be a membrane source of DMVs.The formation of replication sites most likely emerges from the ER membrane, while the major budding sites of SARS- CoV use the membranes in the ERGIC and Golgi region.Nsp3/4/6 domain similarities.Transmembrane domains were determined by CCTop software (http://cctop.enzim.ttk.mta.hu/).The 1D and 2D panels show the amino acid sequence colored by the consensus topology.Colors are based on the localization: gray, black, blue, red, yellow, and orange for transit sequence, signal peptide, extra-cytosolic, cytosolic, membrane, and re-entrant loop regions, respectivelyThe co-expression of all three SARS-CoV NSPs (Nsp3, Nsp4, and Nsp6) is essential to induce DMVs that are comparable to those described in SARS-CoV-infected cells (Fig. 2).These proteins contain particular multiple transmembrane domains that help the virus replication complex via the recruitment of intracellular membranes.The rough ER outer membrane forms an RVN of membranes that includes convoluted membranes and DMVs.DMVs are found in hepatitis C, poliovirus, coxsackievirus, and SARS-CoV infected cells.Therefore, knowing how the virus uses the host cell to hide in DMVs and replicate will lead to the development of therapies, not only against human CoV but against other pathogens that use the same mechanism, as well.In this regard, K22 was identified as a small compound targeting membrane-bound coronaviral RNA synthesis inhibiting DMV formation, viral replication, and infectivity in a wide range of coronaviruses HCoV-229E, FCoV, MHV, IBV, MERS, and SARS-CoV.Phylogenetic trees.Based on sequence alignment, we built a phylogenetic trees of Nsp3 (a), Nsp4 (b), and Nsp6 (c) for coronaviruses strains OC43, 229E, MERS, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 acquired with Clustal Omega and MView visualizationNSP3 is a 215-kDa glycosylated protein with transmembrane domains interacting with several proteins involved in transcription and replication, and also serves as a scaffolding protein for these mechanisms.Nsp3 contains two conserved transmembrane regions that insert into the ER membrane.These transmembrane domains are required for the DMVs’ pairing (Fig. 3a).",3
212,"Nsp3 contains two conserved transmembrane regions that insert into the ER membrane.These transmembrane domains are required for the DMVs’ pairing (Fig. 3a).Exogenous Nsp3, both full length and/or the C-terminal transmembrane-containing region, induces disordered membrane bodies (DMB) as well as multilamellar and giant vesiculation (MGV), showing the ability for the C-terminus to participate in membrane production or expansion of existing membranes.In SARS-infected cells, Nsp3 stimulates membrane buildups that grow larger in size with time supporting.Expression of Nsp3 with either Nsp4 or Nsp6 reduces the formation of MGV but not DMB, indicating that Nsp4 and Nsp6 have a regulatory role on Nsp3′s membrane proliferation ability.Co-transfection of Nsp3 with Nsp4 provokes a particular membrane conformation, generating a perinuclear double-membrane walled maze-like body (MLB), suggesting a significant interaction between Nsp3 and Nsp4 and supporting published data.The C-terminal one-third of Nsp3 (nsp3C) is sufficient to interact with Nsp4 and Nsp6.NSP4Glycosylated Nsp4 is necessary for normal DMV formation, as described in SARS-CoV and MHV.The N-terminal region of Nsp4 comprising the first three transmembrane regions necessary for DMV membrane pairing.We observe in Fig.3b that they are highly conserved among all coronaviruses as well as in SARS-CoV-2 Nsp4.The interaction between Nsp3 and Nsp4 was shown to be necessary for the formation of convoluted membranes (CM) and DMVs in MERS and SARS-CoV, probably through the luminal loops of Nsp3 and Nsp4 positioned in the TM1 and TM2 regions, respectively.The interaction of these domains with their counterparts on the opposite side of the ER lumen induces membrane pairing.The N-terminal region of Nsp3 is required for complete DMVs formation and its TM1 region along with Nsp4 is sufficient to induce membrane pairing.NSP6 is a membrane protein of approximately 34 kDa with six transmembrane helices and a highly conserved C-terminus (Fig. 3c).Inserted in the ER membrane, it associates with Nsp3 and Nsp4 multi-pass transmembrane proteins during the assembly of coronavirus replication complex to form DMVs.Transfection of Nsp6 produces single-membrane small vesicle clustering around the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC).Interestingly, its co-transfection with Nsp4 has a negative effect on this phenotype and Nsp6 is relocalized outside the MTOC area.",4
213,"Transfection of Nsp6 produces single-membrane small vesicle clustering around the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC).Interestingly, its co-transfection with Nsp4 has a negative effect on this phenotype and Nsp6 is relocalized outside the MTOC area.The microtubule scaffolding does not seem necessary for productive infection; however, several members of the RTC circulate in the cell through the microtubules.The avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) Nsp6 has been shown to activate autophagosome formation, inducing vesicles containing Atg5 and LC3-II, and it shares this property with Nsp6 of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV.All the Nsp6 orthologs throughout the Nidovirales order preserved the ability to engender autophagosomes directly from the ER.However, the autophagosomes formed by Nsp6 have smaller sizes compared with those induced by starvation, suggesting that Nsp6 might also inhibit the enlargement of autophagosomes.The mechanisms behind Nsp6-induced autophagy are poorly described, even though involvement of mTOR and the ER stress transcription factor CHOP are neutralized.Nsp6 may modify adaptive immune responses by sending immunomodulatory proteins synthesized by the ER into autophagosomes for degradation.The SARS-CoV-2 Nsp6 protein also interacts with the sigma receptor, which is known to participate in ER stress response.Effect of coronaviruses on neuronsSARS-CoVThe histological examination of brain tissue harvested during the 2003 SARS epidemic has shown degeneration and necrosis of neurons, extensive glial cell hyperplasia, edema, and cellular infiltration.Electron microscopy studies detected viral genomes and viral particles in the cytoplasm of neurons, mostly in the cortex and the hippocampus, confirming that the virus can cross the blood–brain barrier.Interestingly, in patients infected with SARS-CoV, the virus localized almost exclusively to neurons.This observation is congruent with studies showing a distinct neuronal tropism in infected hACE2-Tg mice.Moreover, human neurons are susceptible to SARS-CoV and express ACE2.Note that at least four known coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) possess the property to penetrate the central nervous system (CNS).SARS-CoV-2The great structural similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronaviruses brings the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 also possesses similar neurotrophic and neuro-invasive properties.Furthermore, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the same host receptor, the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).It is proposed that the virus enter the CNS through different routes including the olfactory and trigeminal nerves, the cerebrospinal fluid, the vasculature, and the lymphatic system.The central respiratory failure observed with some patients may be partially due to the neuro-invasive potential of the virus.",5

215,"However, nothing is known about SARS-CoV-2 proteins.Some of these events could be observed, because at least one domain (N- or C-terminal) of BiP, CHOP, or other involved ER factors belong to the group of intrinsically disordered proteins.Any deregulation of one of the domains can alter that protein function and contributes to ER stress.This phenomenon is mainly assured by SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein that associates with the other viral proteins to induce these deregulations.The ER-associated degradation (ERAD) tuning vesicles (or EDEMosomes) controls the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins.EDEMosomes are large vesicles budding from the ER that fuse in an Atg5-dependent manner with lysosomes for degradation of their contents.Coronavirus hijacks the machinery of EDEMososme formation for the production of DMVs.Viral NSPs associate with an EDEMosome cargo receptor that usually organizes the sorting of EDEMososmes from the ER.Furthermore, the unfolded protein response (UPR) maintains ER homeostasis by shutting down the translation and increasing the ER protein folding capacity.However, under sustained ER stress, the UPR can induce apoptotic cell death and cytokine production.The UPR also stimulates transcription of genes encoding proteins that mediate ERAD.Chronic UPR activation has been described in many diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and neurodegeneration.Coronavirus might promote Golgi fragmentationProteins synthesized in the ER are packaged into vesicles that will fuse with the Golgi apparatus.These cargo proteins are modified and destined for secretion via exocytosis or for use in the cell.The Golgi is also involved in lipid transport and lysosome formation.Therefore, provoking its fragmentation can cause the cell to collapse.In this regard, it has been shown that SARS-CoV and MHV infections trigger the rearrangement and fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus.The Golgi complex usually forms a continuous ribbon in mammalian cells and its alteration causes a stress response resulting in cell death.Coronavirus may alter autophagy machineryViruses can use autophagy machinery for their own replication and have also developed strategies to escape autophagic degradation.Recent evidence suggests an inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV and MERS on the autophagy process.MERS blocks the autophagosome/lysosome fusion and causes the suppression of the autophagic flux.However, it was not elucidated if this blockage is mandatory for viral replication.Three MERS proteins are described to limit autophagy, Nsp6, p4b, and p5, with Nsp6 also inhibiting the expansion of autophagosomes as shown for other betacoronaviruses.The actual induction of autophagy in infected cells could be due to other factors, such as the presence of double-stranded RNA within the cell, activation of toll receptor signaling during cell entry, and/or induction of ER stress during replication and envelopment.",7

217,"The angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 receptor is widely distributed in the lungs, heart, liver, kidney, and intestine.After the infection, monocytes migrate to the tissues where they turn into infected resident macrophages, permitting viruses to reach different organs and tissues.Cerebral cytokine storms can result in the breakdown of the BBB and allow monocytes to traverse the BBB physically.In support of this pathway, studies showed a significant heterogeneity in the range of estimates for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood, from 0% in numerous studies, and even up to 76% in a critical care setting.Pooled data estimated that SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detected at low copy numbers in about 10% of blood samples from patients with COVID-19.Neuronal retrograde disseminationThe second major access to the CNS for SARS-CoV-2 could be via a nerve terminal.By this means, some viruses can infect peripheric neurons and enter the CNS via a retrograde axonal transport machinery to the soma.ACE2 is broadly expressed on the epithelial cells of the oral mucosa.SARS-CoV penetrates the brains of hACE2 mice mostly through the olfactory bulb, before spreading to the brain.Olfactory sensory neurons extend dendrites into the nasal cavity and spread out axons across the cribriform plate into the olfactory bulb of the brain.From the lungs, SARS-CoV-2 could spread into the CNS by trans-neural route, through the vagus nerve and the dorsal root ganglia.The trans‐synaptic transfer has been well described for other coronaviruses, such as HEV67 and influenza a.These pathways and their impacts confirm the need for a long-term assessment of neurological damage in the care of SARS-CoV-2 patients.Multiple sclerosis is a disease of unidentified etiology associated with idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system.It is interesting to note that contact with infectious pathogens before puberty seems to increase the risk of developing MS and relapses of the disease are often preceded with respiratory tract infection.Coronavirus-like particles, HCoV RNA, and intrathecal anti-HCoV antibody synthesis indicative of a CNS infection, were detected in autopsied brain tissues from MS patients.In rodents, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection of the CNS triggers neurological symptoms similar to MS. A cross-reactivity between myelin and coronavirus antigens was noticed in T-cell lines isolated from MS patients.Parkinson’s diseaseA potential relationship or at least an epidemiological association between viral infections and PD was first mentioned after the 1920–1930s influenza epidemic, which was associated with Encephalitis Lethargica (EL).The EL patients presented a type of ‘sleeping sickness’ which included uncontrollable sleepiness but also headache, nausea, fever, catatonia, and occasionally coma.",9

223,"Arjunetin as a promising drug candidate against SARS-CoV-2: molecular dynamics simulation studiesAbstractStem and bark of the tree Terminalia arjuna Wight & Arn.(Combretaceae) has been documented to exhibit therapeutic properties like cardiotonic, anticancer, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, hypercholesterolemia, hypolipidemic, and anti-coagulant.Our previous studies have shown that, ethanolic extract of T. arjuna bark exhibits radical scavenging anti-oxidant activity and also effectively inhibited catalase activity.In this study, oleanane triterpenoids type compounds viz., oleanolic acid, arjunolic acid, arjunolitin, arjunetin were isolated from ethanolic bark extract as bio-active compound and their structures were elucidated using 1H, 13C NMR, HR-ESIMS, IR.Of the various compounds, Arjunetin showed significant inhibition of catalase activity as compared to the other compounds.Based on the structural similarity between arjunetin and current antiviral drugs, we propose that arjunetin might exhibit antiviral activity.Molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies showed that arjunetin binds to the binds to key targets of SARS-CoV-2 namely, 3CLpro, PLpro, and RdRp) with a higher binding energy values (3CLpro, -8.4 kcal/mol; PLpro, -7.6 kcal/mol and RdRp, -8.1 kcal/mol) as compared with FDA approved protease inhibitor drugs to Lopinavir (3CLpro, -7.2 kcal/mole and PLpro -7.7 kcal/mole) and Remdesivir (RdRp -7.6 kcal/mole).To further investigate this, we performed 200-500 ns molecular dynamics simulation studies.The results transpired that the binding affinity of Arjunetin is higher than Remdesivir in the RNA binding cavity of RdRp.Based on structural similarity between arjunetin and Saikosaponin (a known antiviral agents) and based on our molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation studies, we propose that arjunetin can be a promising drug candidate against Covid-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

SarmaIntroductionThe World Health Organization reported that infectious diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms to account for about 25% of the total annual deaths that occur worldwide, both in developed as well as developing countries; with the incidence being higher in developing nations (WHO,).In the present time, drastic changes in climate and increasing levels of pollutants in the atmosphere result in accelerating the rate of genetic mutations in these microorganisms, thereby increasing their infectivity.Climate change also increases the contact of insect vectors and animal reservoirs of pathogens with humans, resulting in the emergence of new diseases which are unresponsive to available treatment regimes.Overuse of antibiotics also leads to the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains that are hard to eliminate.Therefore, the discovery of new and novel antibacterial and antivirals coupled with a better understanding of the mechanism of action is the present challenge in research.The FDA approved COVID-19 drugs including Remdesivir and Lopinar suffers a major challenge of post treatment side-effects.For example, remdesivir is a potent drug against SARs-CoV-2, however continuous treatment with remdesivir was found to exert cardiotoxicity which leads to post-treatment complications (Seong et al.,; Yu et al.,).Recent clinical analysis of 1375 case reports has shown that 8.4% of patients treated with remdesivir has suffered serious cardiac complication with a mean cardiac event time as 3.3 days (Concetta et al.,).In this aspect, plant-derived phytochemicals can offer a new direction in developing methods for disease control.The major advantage of these traditional systems of medicine such as Ayurveda, Siddha, or Unani is that, they depend on natively available flora and has been in treatment of almost all kinds of maladies for centuries.Recent studies have also shown natural products have potential alternate therapeutics against SARs-CoV-2 (Cheorl, 2021).For instance Rotiorinol-C and Scutifoliamide-A has shown potent binding towards SARs-CoV-2 RDRp (Sinosh et al.,).Glycyrrhizin, a bio-active triterpenoid phytochemical from Glycyrrhiza glabra has potent inhibitory effect against SARs-CoV-2 protease and replicase protein (Lukas et al.,).Further, the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory property of Glycyrrhizin was also found to exert protection against the organ damage thereby improving the therapeutic outcome (Zhaoyan et al.,).Similarly, Saikosaponin, a triterpenoid from Bupleuri Radix, has shown potent inhibitory activity against SARs-CoV-2 proteases and RdRp (Xian et al.,).",1
225,"Further, the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory property of Glycyrrhizin was also found to exert protection against the organ damage thereby improving the therapeutic outcome (Zhaoyan et al.,).Similarly, Saikosaponin, a triterpenoid from Bupleuri Radix, has shown potent inhibitory activity against SARs-CoV-2 proteases and RdRp (Xian et al.,).There is a strong need in isolating novel antiviral molecules from traditional medicinal plants, with minimal side effects.Terminalia Arjuna (TA) (Family: Combretaceae), a tree native to the Indian subcontinent, is extensively used in many traditional forms of medicine for the treatment of hypertension and coronary heart diseases (Dwivedi & Chopra,), earning it the epitaph of 'Guardian of the heart'.It is known to confer cardioprotective properties such as strengthening heart muscles and improving the functioning of cardiac muscles, thereby alleviating heart failure, angina and hypercholesterolemia.Stem and bark of this plant exhibit various other therapeutic properties such as expectorant, anti-dysenteric, purgative, laxative and have also been used to treat leucoderma, anemia, hyperhidrosis, asthma, and tumors (Jain et al.,).In addition, it has also been reported that the bark of T. arjuna also possesses good anticancer, antiviral, and antimicrobial activities (Cooper,; Patil & Gaikwad,; Tripathi & Singh,).It has been hypothesized that the cardioprotective activity of TA bark extracts is likely by the activation of endogenous antioxidant molecules by triterpenes, namely arjunolic acid (Dwivedi,; Pawar & Bhutani,; Sumitra et al.,).Previous studies carried on the elucidation of properties of T. arjuna showed that catalase activity was inhibited by ethanolic bark extract in vitro (Padma Sree et al.,).The enzyme catalase is one of the endogenous antioxidant defense systems that help in decreasing the accumulation of reactive oxygen by decomposing hydrogen peroxide during cellular metabolism to water and molecular oxygen.It is postulated that catalase activity protects pathogens from inactivation by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in eukaryotic systems, making it a potential virulence factor in many bacterial pathogens.Studies have shown that catalase facilitates intracellular survival of bacterial pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Manca et al.,), Campylobacter jejuni (Day et al.,), Helicobacter pylori (Basu et al., 2004), and Herpes Simplex Virus (Newcomb et al.,).It has also been reported that increased serum catalase activity may also alter immune function, viral replication, and/or repair processes (Roth et al., 1987; Schreck et al., ).",2
226,"Studies have shown that catalase facilitates intracellular survival of bacterial pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Manca et al.,), Campylobacter jejuni (Day et al.,), Helicobacter pylori (Basu et al., 2004), and Herpes Simplex Virus (Newcomb et al.,).It has also been reported that increased serum catalase activity may also alter immune function, viral replication, and/or repair processes (Roth et al., 1987; Schreck et al., ).In this regard, the catalase inhibitor in T. arjuna extract necessitates further research.We believe T. arjuna stands as a potential candidate for the development of an effective therapeutic agent for the current pandemic respiratory disease, COVID-19, which emerged in December 2019 and has been spreading at a rapid rate all over the world with a high rate of infectivity and mortality.The viral pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, appears to spread more efficiently, making it difficult to contain and increasing its pandemic potential (Wu et al.,; Situation report 15 May 2020).One of the important pathological aspects of COVID 19 is its effect on the cardiovascular system and T. arjuna has well-documented cardioprotective properties, making it an excellent match.Catalase inhibition is another important aspect that has been shown to inhibit viral replication and spread.Literature shows that bark extract of T. arjuna possesses anti-herpesvirus activity in preventing viral attachment and penetration and also disturbing the late event of infection (Hua et al.,).Consolidating information available from literature and experiments conducted in our lab on T. arjuna extracts, it is evident that T. arjuna can be regarded as an apt candidate in the search for antivirals against COVID-19.In this study, different solvent extracts of TA and the purified compounds from ethanol extracts have been evaluated for their effect on catalase activity.Also, molecular docking studies of the isolated compound from ethanolic bark extract have been carried out on protease of SARS-CoV-2.To further confirm this, we performed molecular dynamics simulation studies and found that arjunetin is a potential inhibitor against three proteases of SARS-CoV-2 viz.3CLpro, PLpro, and RdRP as compared with FDA approved drugs Lopinavir and Remdesivir.The present study will serve as a frontier for the much-needed research on drug development for COVID-19.Materials and methodsCollection of plant materialsThe dry stem bark of Terminalia arjuna was obtained from the Centre of Traditional Medicine and Research (CTMR), Chennai, India, and collected from Pillaiyarpattai, Sri Karpagam Vinayager Temple thalaviruksha, Sivagangai District, Tamil Nadu, India, and authenticated at Siddha Central Research Institute, Arumbakkam, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India (voucher specimen no.",3

243,"On the other hand, in Lig fit Prot, the receptor-ligand complex is aligned with the protein backbone in the first frame, and then the fluctuations in the ligand heavy atoms are measured.The Lig fit Prot describes the stability of the ligand to protein and its binding pocket.In the case of 3 CL protease complexed with Arjunetin, the RMSD plot (Figure 7b) shows that the simulation is approaching a plateau within 2 ns with the protein and ligand RMSD values of 2.03 A and 2.12 A, respectively, indicating that 0-2 ns of the trajectory range should be sufficient one to reach the convergence.Furthermore, we have explored the ligand's stability relative to protein and found an average RMSD value of 2.85 A after 140 ns of MD run.A sharp increase in the ligand's RMSD relative to protein is observed after 140 ns of simulation with a final average value of the deviation of 3.89 A (Figure 7b).This sudden rise in ligand RMSD indicates that the ligand moves from one binding pocket to another during the simulation.Moreover, we have performed hydrogen-bond analysis (Figure 7c) throughout the trajectory, which indicates that a maximum number of the H-bonds (~2-8) between 3 CL protease and Arjunetin has found between 0 ns to 140 ns, the number diminishes to zero for next 20 ns of trajectory, beyond which the average reaches to ~0-3, suggesting a drastic change in the ligand positioning.Between 142 ns to 164 ns, no H-bonding interactions were found, indicating that the ligand has started to diffuse away from the binding pocket.This fact is in line with the sudden rise in the lig fit Prot RMSD plot after 140 ns depicted in Figure 7b.To validate the above observation, we have calculated the average interaction energies of arjunetin with the surrounding amino acid residues in the 3CL protease's binding pocket.For this, we have considered only those residues which are in close proximity to the ligand (within 6 A).The average interaction energies are calculated by the summation of the van der Waals, electrostatic, polar solvation, and nonpolar solvation values for a particular residue (the internal energies were zero in all cases).The results indicate that Glu47 (-1.1 kcal/mol), Leu50 (-1.2 kcal/mol), Met165 (-0.9 kcal/mol), Leu167 (-1.0 kcal/mol), Gln189 (-2.2 kcal/mol), Thr190 (-2.1 kcal/mol), Gln192 (-2.3 kcal/mol) contribute to the most favourable interactions over all residues in the system while Ser46and Asn142are making the most unfavourable interactions (>0 kcal/mol) (Figure 7d).The principal component analysis reveals that the inhibitor is located between the Gln189 and Ser 46 residues, the former being highly stabilizing and the later destabilizing.As the simulation proceeds, Ser46 gradually moves away from arjunetin due to its unfavourable interactions with all other residues.",20
244,"The principal component analysis reveals that the inhibitor is located between the Gln189 and Ser 46 residues, the former being highly stabilizing and the later destabilizing.As the simulation proceeds, Ser46 gradually moves away from arjunetin due to its unfavourable interactions with all other residues.It widens the path for the arjunetin to move, and under physiological conditions, the path becomes more solvent-exposed, facilitating the removal of the ligand from the binding pocket.At the same time, Gln189, which has highly favourable interaction with the surroundings (-2.2 kcal/mol), was anchored to its position strictly and was not shifting to restrict the movement of the ligand.In the second binding pocket, significant stabilizing interaction is introduced by Trp218 (-0.2 kcal/mol), Asn277 (-0.2 kcal/mol), and Arg279 (-0.7 kcal/mol) residues responsible for locking the ligand in the binding site (Figure 7d).The distance RMSD plot (Figure 7e, red curve) between the two opposite residues, Ser 46 and Gln189, shows a continuous rise supporting the above fact.Moreover, we have compared the RMS deviation in the three connecting loops at the periphery of the first binding pocket, loop1 (residues 44-54), loop2 (residues175-200), and loop3 (residues130-147), and conclude that it is the outward movement of loop1 (containing Ser 46) responsible for the arjunetin removal (Figure 1e, loop1: green curve, loop2: pink curve, loop3: blue curve).In the previous study, Talarico and co-workers have described the conformational dynamics of the loops (residues 44-53 and 184-193), which are situated at the entrance of the 3CLp binding pocket (Grottesi et al.,).In the free protease, the Met49 and Arg188 groups are located at the entrance, and the inter-residue distance increases during the simulation, leading to structural re-arrangements in the loops, resulting in the binding pocket region being more exposed to the bulk solvent.Our study is in agreement with the dynamic behaviour of the 3CL-protease observed earlier.We have estimated the free energy associated with the arjunetin binding in the different binding pockets of 3 CL protease using MM-PBSA script implemented in Amber 16and AmberTools packages.The calculated binding energy of the inhibitor in the first pocket is -21.7 +- 5.0 kcal/mol and in the second pocket is -3.7 +- 3.1 kcal/mol.",21
245,"We have estimated the free energy associated with the arjunetin binding in the different binding pockets of 3 CL protease using MM-PBSA script implemented in Amber 16and AmberTools packages.The calculated binding energy of the inhibitor in the first pocket is -21.7 +- 5.0 kcal/mol and in the second pocket is -3.7 +- 3.1 kcal/mol.Despite higher affinity in the first binding pocket, a high destabilizing polar solvation energy (27.4 +- 6.8 kcal/mol) is responsible for shifting the ligand to another binding pocket with comparatively less polar solvation energy (9.3 +- 3.1 kcal/mol).During the translational movement of the ligand, the entropy of the system is also increased by ~8 J K-1, making the process spontaneous.In contrast to 3 CL protease-arjunetin, the PL protease complexed with arjunetin reaches an equilibrium after the extended 160 ns of MD run and continued to remain stable, with an average RMSD value of 2.54 A (Figure 8b).The ligand RMSD of rigid arjunetin reaches stability within 50 ns.Although the relative positioning of the ligand to protein is only partially stable, having the RMSD value in the range of 3-4 A, the ligand remained bound to the same binding pocket.The PCA analysis confirms that the large fluctuation in the RMS value of protein and the Lig fit Prot between 70-140 ns is mainly due to the structural orientation of arjunetin during the simulation, and it is shifting towards the favourable interactions inside the same cavity.The maximum number of the H-bonds between the ligand (Arjunetin) and the receptor PL protease is found between 0 to 20 ns.After that, the number started to fall and again increases after 160 ns with the average reach to ~4 and remains stable.The 25,000 to 80,000 trajectory frames with the least number of interactions reflect the large fluctuations between 50 ns to 160 ns in the receptor structure and Lig fit Prot RMSD value (Figure 8c).Initially, the ligand is surrounded with the most unfavorable interactions (>0.05 kcal/mol) in one side exerted from Lys157 (1.5 kcal/mol), Arg166 (0.07 kcal/mol), Thr168 (0.2 kcal/mol), Gln174 (0.2 kcal/mol), Val202 (0.06 kcal/mol), Glu203 (0.1 kcal/mol), Thr301 (0.02 kcal/mol) residues (Figure 8d) enforce it for reorganization within the cavity and to move towards comparatively more favorable interactions.Figure 8(a-B) represents ensemble 1.",22
246,"Initially, the ligand is surrounded with the most unfavorable interactions (>0.05 kcal/mol) in one side exerted from Lys157 (1.5 kcal/mol), Arg166 (0.07 kcal/mol), Thr168 (0.2 kcal/mol), Gln174 (0.2 kcal/mol), Val202 (0.06 kcal/mol), Glu203 (0.1 kcal/mol), Thr301 (0.02 kcal/mol) residues (Figure 8d) enforce it for reorganization within the cavity and to move towards comparatively more favorable interactions.Figure 8(a-B) represents ensemble 1.The interaction energies of the ligand (Figure 8d) in ensemble-1 shows that the ligand has moved to the side of the cavity with more stabilizing interactions around it, namely Gly209 (-0.8 kcal/mol), Gln221 (-0.8 kcal/mol), Ile222 (-1.1 kcal/mol), Pro223 (-0.8 kcal/mol), Pro247 (-1.4 kcal/mol), Pro248 (-0.4 kcal/mol) (Figure 8e).The final binding energy during the simulation is calculated to be -12.9 +- 3.6 kcal/mol towards 200 ns of MD run.In the next set of protease-inhibitor systems, the 3CL protease complexed with Lopinavir, we observe a significant fluctuation from 7 ns to 20 ns in the protein RMSD (2.40 A) which is in agreement with the previous studies on the same complex.In contrast to rigid arjunetin, where the ligand reaches an early equilibrium with low deviation, a large ligand RMSD (>4 A) is observed for Lopinavir, which is still acceptable as the RMSD values are overestimated due to the rotation of symmetrical functional groups and the phenyl rings of the large molecule (Figure 9b).The PL protease-Lopinavir complex attains stability after 23 ns with a protein RMSD value of 2.61 A (Figure 10b).Similar to 3CL protease-Lopinavir, the lig fit lig is also overestimated in this case.The average number of H-bonds between the receptor and ligand in the case of the 3CL protease-Lopinavir complex was ranging from 0 to 2, and this number increases to 3 as it approaches towards 200 ns, indicating a better stabilization of the ligand to the binding pocket (Figure 9c).This number is between 0 and 2 for PL protease-Lopinavir in most of the frames (Figure 10c).The MM-PBSA binding free energy of Lopinavir complexed with 3CL-protease is -27.5 +- 3.1 kcal/mol while that PL-protease is -15.9 +- 4.9 kcal/mol.",23
247,"This number is between 0 and 2 for PL protease-Lopinavir in most of the frames (Figure 10c).The MM-PBSA binding free energy of Lopinavir complexed with 3CL-protease is -27.5 +- 3.1 kcal/mol while that PL-protease is -15.9 +- 4.9 kcal/mol.The higher binding affinity of -5.8 kcal/mol of the Lopinavir towards 3CL-protease than that of arjunetin (before 140 ns, in the first binding pocket) is mainly due to the lowering of the polar solvation energy by -11.8 kcal/mol for Lopinavir.Moreover, the stabilizing van der Waals interaction is 4.3 kJ/mol lower for arjunetin.Although the electrostatic interaction energy shifted by -10.1 kcal/mol for arjunetin, this stabilizing energy is more than compensated by the previously described van der Waals and polar solvation energies.PL-protease-arjunetin is found to be comparable with PL-protease-Lopinavir; in agreement with the experimental results, i.e.the binding free energy is 3 kcal/mol lower in the case of arjunetin.For 3CL protease-LopinavirLeu27 (-0.7 kcal/mol), His41 (-0.7 kcal/mol), Met49 (-3.0 kcal/mol), Cys145 (-1.2 kcal/mol), His164 (-1.8 kcal/mol), Met165 (-1.2 kcal/mol), Pro168 (-1.2 kcal/mol), Gln189 (-1.2 kcal/mol) groups contribute to the favorable interactions while Glu47 (0.1 kcal/mol), Asn142 (0.2 kcal/mol), Glu166 (0.3 kcal/mol), Arg188 (0.2 kcal/mol) contribute towards destabilization (Yogesh et al.,).Several studies have been reported on the Remdesivir complexed with RNA-polymerase previously and proposed that the protein-inhibitor complex is relatively stable during the simulation, and the equilibration is achieved within 30 ns (Wakchaure et al.,).Therefore, to save the computational cost, we extend the simulation for the Remdesivir-bound RdRp to 100 ns.The protein and the Lig fit Lig RMSD of Remdesivir-bound RdRp are found to achieve equilibration within 40 ns and remain invariable during the entire simulation process.This is in agreement with the previous observations and provides confidence that a 100 ns simulation is enough to study the dynamics of the presently studied protein-inhibitor system.",24
248,"The protein and the Lig fit Lig RMSD of Remdesivir-bound RdRp are found to achieve equilibration within 40 ns and remain invariable during the entire simulation process.This is in agreement with the previous observations and provides confidence that a 100 ns simulation is enough to study the dynamics of the presently studied protein-inhibitor system.The Lig fit Prot graph shows a greater deviation and stabilizes during the last 10 ns of simulation, having an RMSD value of 2.8 A.It reflects the fact that during the process, the ligand reorients inside the cavity get the maximum stabilization in terms of hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, electrostatic, polar, and nonpolar interactions.Figure 11(A)-(C) represents the highest populated ensembles during simulation A, where B represents the structures near 100 ns, C represents the starting frames, while A represents the intermediate frames.We can observe that initially, ensemble 3(C) with no stabilizing protein-ligand H-bonding interaction simulates towards ensemble 1(B), having the maximum number of stabilizing interactions (~5).This fact is reflected in Figure 5(c), where the number of hydrogen bonds per frame between Remdesivir and protein is shown during the entire simulation.The maximum number of H-bond interactions (0 to 7) is observed after 50 ns which corresponds to the ensemble 1 and 2.The inhibitor's average binding energy inside the cavity is -7.6 +- 3.8 kcal/mol, which is in line with the predicted binding energy value of -7.6 kcal/mol.Figure 11(d) shows that the favorable interactions inside the cavity are coming from Ser491 (-1.9 kcal/mol), Ala492 (-2.2 kcal/mol), Arg495 (-1.8 kcal/mol), Arg497 (-1.9 kcal/mol), Asp702 (-2.1 kcal/mol) and Asp703 (-0.5 kcal/mol) residues while the most destabilizing interactions are exerted by the Asp560 (0.7 kcal/mol), Lys563 (0.6 kcal/mol), Asp565 (0.5 kcal/mol), Glu753(0.5 kcal/mol) residues.In contrast to the Remdesivir-RNA-polymerase inhibitor-receptor system, the arjunetin complex RdRP reaches a late equilibration after 150 ns of the production run, having an average RMSD value of 3.28 A during the simulation.Like the previous complexes, the rigid arjunetin molecule attains stability within 50 ns with a lower RMSD value of 1.89 A.This indicates the arjunetin molecule to be highly rigid with a minimal internal deviation of the atoms.",25
249,"Like the previous complexes, the rigid arjunetin molecule attains stability within 50 ns with a lower RMSD value of 1.89 A.This indicates the arjunetin molecule to be highly rigid with a minimal internal deviation of the atoms.The almost superimposable protein and Lig fit Prot RMSD graphs indicate that the ligand is stable within the protein binding pocket; Only the receptor fluctuates during the simulation.The higher stability of the ligand inside the binding pocket reflects a greater value (~3.13) of the average number of hydrogen bonds throughout the trajectory (Figure 12c).It shows that the number of H-bonding interactions between the receptor and the ligand increases gradually from 0 ns to 160 ns.The average reaches the maximum (4.9) after that and remains stable.The calculated binding energy of inhibitor arjunetin is -10.7 +- 4.4 kcal/mol, which is very close to the experimentally observed value of -7.8 kcal/mol.Figure 6(d) shows that inside the pocket, the inhibitor molecule is surrounded by the highly stabilizing Tyr397 (-0.7 kcal/mol), Arg495 (-0.9 kcal/mol), Arg497 (-1.9 kcal/mol), Tyr561 (-0.9 kcal/mol), Asp565 (-0.5 kcal/mol), Asp702 (-1.9 kcal/mol), Asp703 (-2.9 kcal/mol), Glu753 (-1.5 kcal/mol), Phe754 (-1.3 kcal/mol), Cys755 (-1.8 kcal/mol), Ser756 (-1.3 kcal/mol) residues and destabilizing Lys487 (0.6 kcal/mol), Lys563 (2.3 kcal/mol), Arg566 (2.2 kcal/mol), Ser701 (0.5 kcal/mol) residues.From the interaction energy value of the individual residues, we can conclude that several stabilizing interactions surround the inhibitor, restricting its movement during the simulation, which is also observable in the less deviation in the Lig fit Lig graph in Figure 12(b).The binding energy of arjunetin is higher than Remdesivir due to the greater stabilizing van der Waals (-21.4 +- 1.6 kcal/mol vs. -18.1 +- 1.7 kcal/mol, respectively) and electrostatic interactions (-30.3 +- 4.4 kcal/mol vs. -23.1 +- 3.7 kcal/mol, respectively).",26
250,"From the interaction energy value of the individual residues, we can conclude that several stabilizing interactions surround the inhibitor, restricting its movement during the simulation, which is also observable in the less deviation in the Lig fit Lig graph in Figure 12(b).The binding energy of arjunetin is higher than Remdesivir due to the greater stabilizing van der Waals (-21.4 +- 1.6 kcal/mol vs. -18.1 +- 1.7 kcal/mol, respectively) and electrostatic interactions (-30.3 +- 4.4 kcal/mol vs. -23.1 +- 3.7 kcal/mol, respectively).However, the destabilizing polar solvation energy for Arjunetin is higher (44.1 +- 4.0 kcal/mol) than Remdesivir (35.5 +- 3.3 kcal/mol).From the above comparative study, we can say that the binding affinity of Arjunetin (-10.7 kcal/mol) is higher than Remdesivir (-7.6 kcal/mol) in the binding cavity of RNA-polymerase.Although the former protein-inhibitor complex reaches a late equilibration (after 150 ns) compared to the RNA-polymerase-Remdesivir complex having an early stabilization, after equilibration, the inhibitor Arjunetin molecule is surrounded by several favorable interactions anchoring it strongly to the cavity.Therefore, Arjunetin is concluded to be a potent RdRp inhibitor.We have extended the molecular dynamics simulation of CL-protease-arjunetin (300 ns), PL-protease-arjunetin (500 ns), and RNA-polymerase-arjunetin (350 ns) complexes and plotted time-dependent root mean square deviation (RMSD) graphs (see Figure 13).The RMSD plot with extended simulation time reveals a similar kind of behavior as observed for the 200 ns simulation.For CL-protease-arjunetin, we found a shifting of the binding region after 140 ns, and after 300 ns of extended MD run, the binding site remains constant, with the binding energy of 3.1 kcal/mol.The MM-PBSA calculated average binding energy of arjunetin in RNA-polymerase after 350 ns of simulation is -11.6 kcal/mol, which is -10.7 kcal/mol after 200 ns of MD run.Therefore, it is observed that after 200 ns there is no significant behavioral change has been found.The scenario is similar for the PL-protease-arjunetin complex (binding energy after 500 ns -15.7 kcal/mol).These observations provide confidence in our simulation results as well as simulation time.Time dependent RMSD graphs of (a) 300 ns of CL-protease-arjunetin, (b) 500 ns of PL-protease-arjunetin and (c) 350 ns of RNA-polymerase-arjunetin, where RMSDs of the protein (brick red curve), Lig fit Lig (green curve), and Lig fit Prot (grey curve) are plotted against time (ns).All atoms of a ligand were considered.",27
