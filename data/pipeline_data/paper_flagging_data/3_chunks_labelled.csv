35,35,"SARS-CoV-2 infection in the mouse olfactory systemSARS-CoV-2 infection causes a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in humans, and olfactory dysfunction is one of the most predictive and common symptoms in COVID-19 patients.However, the underlying mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to olfactory disorders remains elusive.Herein, we demonstrate that intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 induces robust viral replication in the olfactory epithelium (OE), not the olfactory bulb (OB), resulting in transient olfactory dysfunction in humanized ACE2 (hACE2) mice.The sustentacular cells and Bowman's gland cells in the OE were identified as the major target cells of SARS-CoV-2 before invasion into olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs).Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers massive cell death and immune cell infiltration and directly impairs the uniformity of the OE structure.Combined transcriptomic and quantitative proteomic analyses revealed the induction of antiviral and inflammatory responses, as well as the downregulation of olfactory receptor (OR) genes in the OE from the infected animals.Overall, our mouse model recapitulates olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients and provides critical clues for understanding the physiological basis for extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19.IntroductionThe emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to a global crisis.The clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection predominantly involve the respiratory system, including cough, sore throat, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).As the disease continues to spread widely, a significant portion of COVID-19 patients are developing anosmia, hyposmia, or other olfactory dysfunctions according to clinical reports.Accumulated evidence has established the alteration of smell as one of the most predictive symptoms for COVID-19 screening.The perception of smell begins with odorant binding to the olfactory receptors (ORs) of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) along the upper surface of the olfactory epithelium (OE).Each OSN projects an axon into the glomerulus of the olfactory bulb (OB) and then synapses with second-order neurons to convey odour information to the olfactory cortex.Previously, upper respiratory tract infections were considered a common cause of olfactory disorders.Mouse models have been used to reproduce olfactory system infection and subsequent olfactory dysfunction.",0,1
36,36,"Previously, upper respiratory tract infections were considered a common cause of olfactory disorders.Mouse models have been used to reproduce olfactory system infection and subsequent olfactory dysfunction.For example, post viral olfactory disorders were observed in Sendai virus-infected mice by the buried food pellet test (BFPT), as well as the impairment of OE and OB tissues.However, an animal model that can recapitulate the olfactory dysfunctions seen in COVID-19 patients remains lacking.Human nasal respiratory epithelium (RE) cells exhibit high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2.Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses have characterized the expression profile of ACE2 in the OE of mice and humans, mainly in non-neuroepithelial cells, and in a recent study based on a hamster model, many SARS-CoV-2-infected cells were observed in the OE section.In addition, vascular pericytes in the OB exhibited a high level of ACE2 expression in a mouse model; these cells play a key role in the maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, as well as the regulation of blood pressure and the host immune response.Interestingly, some respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus, are able to invade the OB and other parts of the brain to establish infection.Thus, how SARS-CoV-2 invades the olfactory system and contributes to the observed central nervous system (CNS) diseases remains to be determined.In the present study, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection directly causes transient olfactory dysfunction in an established mouse model and characterize the major target cells and pathological effects that contribute to olfactory dysfunction.ResultsSARS-CoV-2 targets the OE and causes transient olfactory dysfunction in hACE2 miceSARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the OE and causes olfactory dysfunction in hACE2 mice.a Schematic diagram of the experimental design.Briefly, groups of 6-8-week-old hACE2 mice were infected with 5.4 x 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 intranasally.The olfactory function of infected mice was measured by the buried food pellet test at the indicated times post inoculation.Mice were sacrificed at 2 dpi and 4 dpi for viral detection and histopathological analysis.b Schematic view of the OM in the nasal cavity of mice in a sagittal plane.The dotted line indicates a coronal section (upper).Viral genomic RNA (gRNA, middle) and subgenomic RNA (sgRNA, lower) copies were determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and are shown as means +- SD from three independent replicates.",0,2

38,38,"Additionally, high levels of viral subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) (2.24 x 108 RNA copies/mouse), indicating the presence of actively replicating virus, were detected in the OM at 2 dpi, and subsequently decreased at 4 dpi (9.89 x 106 RNA copies/mouse); however, the sgRNA levels in the OB and brain were below the detection threshold (Fig.1b).As expected, in situ hybridization (ISH) by RNAscope demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was predominantly detected in OE (Supplementary Fig.S2a) but not in the OB (Supplementary Fig.S2b).Furthermore, an immunofluorescence staining assay detected high levels of SARS-CoV-2 N protein expression in the OE along the OM at 2 dpi (Fig.1c), and only marginal expression of viral protein was observed at 8 dpi (Supplementary Fig.S3).However, we did not detect SARS-CoV-2 N protein-positive cells in the OB or other parts of the brain at 2 dpi and 4 dpi (Supplementary Fig.S2c).To examine whether SARS-CoV-2 infection directly impairs the olfactory function of infected mice, a standard BFPT was conducted at 2 and 4 dpi.Remarkably, a significantly increased latency (152.8 s vs 81.8 s; P = 0.022) to locate food pellets was observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice compared with the control animals at 2 dpi (Fig.1d).Of particular note, 2 out of the 13 infected mice developed severe symptoms of anosmia, as they failed to locate the food pellet within the observation period.Interestingly, recovery of infected mice from olfactory dysfunction was observed at 4 dpi, as the latency to locate food pellets was not different from that of the control animals (67.1 s vs 70.2 s; P = 0.992).Thus, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the OE and leads to transient olfactory dysfunction in mice.SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets non-neuroepithelial cells in the OE of hACE2 miceThe OM consists of the OE and the underlying lamina propria (LP).The OE is composed of olfactory stem/progenitor cells, including the horizontal basal cells (HBCs) and globose basal cells (GBCs) residing in the basal region, mature and immature OSNs, and a variety of non-neuroepithelial lineages, including the sustentacular cells, microvillar cells, and Bowman's gland cells.The OSNs lining under the supporting cells project numerous dendritic cilia with ORs into the nasal cavity and intermingle with the microvilli of sustentacular cells and microvillar cells (Supplementary Fig.S4a).Due to the asymmetrical expression pattern of ACE2 on the cell membrane as well as the unique organization of the OE, it is not easy to determine which cell compartments express ACE2.",0,4
39,39,"S4a).Due to the asymmetrical expression pattern of ACE2 on the cell membrane as well as the unique organization of the OE, it is not easy to determine which cell compartments express ACE2.To overcome this, we took advantage of the tdTomato cassette downstream of the hACE2 transgene with an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which allows the detection of hACE2 expression by cytoplasmic fluorescence of tdTomato (Supplementary Fig.S4b).Abundant expression of hACE2 along the apical surface of the OE and within the underlying LP was detected with a human ACE2-specific monoclonal antibody, exhibiting a similar expression pattern as tdTomato (Supplementary Fig.S4c).A detailed characterization of hACE2/tdTomato-expressing cells in the OM revealed that non-neuroepithelial cells, including sustentacular cells (CK8 positive, Supplementary Fig.S4d, d1), the duct and acinus of Bowman's gland cells (Sox9/CK8 positive, Supplementary Fig.S4d, d2, d4) in the OE and LP, respectively, and microvillar cells (CD73/CK8 positive, Supplementary Fig.S4e), are the primary cell types that exhibit human ACE2 expression (Supplementary Fig.S4d, f), whereas little hACE2/tdTomato expression was detected in the neuroepithelial lineages, including HBCs (CK5 positive), GBCs (Sox2 positive in the basal region), immature olfactory sensory neurons (iOSNs) (GAP43 positive), and mature olfactory sensory neurons (mOSNs) (OMP positive) (Supplementary Fig.S4d, d1-d4).SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets non-neuroepithelial cells in the OE.a Representative multiplex immunofluorescent staining assay showing that SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 N protein positive) infects sustentacular cells (CK8 positive, yellow arrows), Bowman's gland cells (Sox9/CK8 positive, white arrows), microvillar cells (CD73/CK8 positive, cyan arrows), HBCs (CK5 positive, gold arrows), and iOSNs (GAP43 positive, green arrows) at 2 dpi.Little SARS-CoV-2 N protein was detected within OMP-positive mOSNs.b Statistical analysis of the percentage of each cell compartment within SARS-CoV-2-positive cells.The data are presented as means +- SD (n = 3).c Multiplex immunofluorescent staining results showing an OM sample at 4 dpi with SARS-CoV-2 detected in the OMP-positive mOSNs and the underlying nerve bundles.The framed areas labeled c1 and c2 are shown adjacently at larger magnifications.",0,5
