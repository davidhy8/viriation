1488,"Given the mandated quarantine for discharged patients at a designated center for a minimum of 14 days followed by another 14 days at home (total 28 days of strict social distancing, shelter-in-place), the observed overall rate and multiple recurrence of positive viral testing are unlikely to be from re-infection.This contrasts with the recently case reports in South Korea, where in recovered patients were home quarantined and recurrence of PCR positivity there could have arisen from either dormant virus reactivation or re-infection.COVID-19 patients with multiple recurrences of PCR positivity have not been previously reported.Thirteen and three cases recurred two and three times with PCR positivity, respectively, making it likely that the re-emergence of PCR positivity is due to low levels of viral RNA right at the level of detectability by PCR assay and therefore is at times below this threshold and other times above.The Ct values observed in the samples after the initial positive samples are all high suggesting potential non-viable viral RNA.However, the reimmigration of the virus from the lower to the upper respiratory tract cannot be ruled out.Importantly, it must be noted that the positive SARS-CoV-2 test does not equate with infectivity.Since the current standard for SARS-CoV-2 test positivity is predicated on viral load detection by PCR, sample testing in the case cohort of < 106 copies per sample may not represent a live virus isolate.Unless equipped with a live virus isolate, we cannot be certain whether these retest positive patients were capable of infecting others (contagious) given that they were quarantined at a designated center.To address the possibility of false positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results, every retest was validated by examinations at both laboratories of Center for Disease Control in Shenzhen and the Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology.95% tests were consistent.The PCR retest positivity cannot differentiate re-infectivity, relapse, and dead-viral RNA detection.Handoff note, a postmortem pathological study found that SARS-CoV-2-viruses still remained in pneumocytes of a recovered COVID-19 patient with a negative PCR test result.Ninety-three percent of the retest positive patients had mild or moderate severity disease during their first hospitalization.No obvious trending was found in this case series between the initial viral load and first admission symptoms as has been previously reported, e.g.temperature (Supplementary Fig.S6), consistent with previous findings.The two readmitted febrile patients with typical clinical manifestations satisfying the COVID-19 diagnostic and admitting criteria may have been capable of transmission given the presence of positivity with both viral load testing and COVID-19 admission symptoms.The key rationale of the local health policy for implementing the described strict center-based quarantine is to prevent transmission.Our findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of this quarantine strategy in the management of the pandemic may be crucial in minimizing late transmission.",11,85,0,0.6977323

180,"SARS-CoV-2 infection did not affect levels of ACE2 expression, but noticeably induced MIRb-ACE2 expression (Fig.4b).Lastly, analysis of RNA-seq data from explanted lung tissue from a single COVID-19 patient demonstrated elevated expression of MIRb-ACE2, but not of ACE2, compared with healthy lung tissue (Fig.4c), albeit statistical comparisons were not possible in this case.To further confirm the IFN-responsiveness exclusively of MIRb-ACE2 expression, we used SCC-4 and SCC-25 cells, which express both isoforms.Compared with mock treatment, addition of recombinant IFNalpha or IFNgamma had a minimal effect on ACE2 expression in SCC-4 cells and no effect in SCC-25 cells (Fig.4d).This contrasted with very strong induction (~15-fold) of MIRb-ACE2 expression by either type of IFN in both cell lines (Fig.4d).Lack of ACE responsiveness to IFN stimulation was additionally confirmed at the protein level, where neither IFNalpha nor IFNgamma affected levels of full-length ACE2, detected by Western blotting in SCC-4 and SCC-25 cells or in A549 cells, which express neither isoform and were used as a negative control (Fig.4e).Splicing from the LTR16A1 retroelement to exon 10 of ACE2 is in-frame and therefore the last 449 amino acids of ACE2 are also present in the putative MIRb-ACE2 protein.Of note, despite strong upregulation at the mRNA level and despite using polyclonal antibodies (ab15348) targeting the C-terminus of ACE2 present in both protein products, we were unable to detect a truncated form that would correspond to the MIRb-ACE2 translation product in SCC-4 or SCC-25 cells (Fig.4e).To confirm the differential IFN inducibility of ACE2 and MIRb-ACE2 expression, we stimulated NHBE cells with IFNalpha, IFNbeta or IFNlambda, as previously described.Again, treatment with none of the IFNs had any measurable effect on ACE2 expression in these primary cells (Fig.4f).This contrasted with robust induction of MIRb-ACE2 expression, particularly by IFNalpha (Fig.",6,9,0,0.6386454
426,"The RPN pools (n = 304) were prepared in an isolated class II biological safety cabinet at a separate location from the Clinical Microbiology and research labs that had never been used for handling respiratory specimens or viruses.Briefly, 400 microL of viral transport medium from each specimen was manually aliquoted one at a time into a sterile 5 mL snap-cap centrifuge tube (ASi, C2520).Once each specimen was aliquoted, the 4 mL volume was mixed manually by pipetting and 600 muL aliquots were reserved for SARS-CoV-2 NAAT.RPN specimens and pools were stored at -80  C.SARS-CoV-2 NAATTo test for SARS-CoV-2 in RPN pools, 600 muL aliquots underwent NAAT by the cobas  6800 SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR Test (Roche, 09175431190) in the MSHS Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, which is certified under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C.263a and meets the requirements to perform high complexity tests.Aliquots were run in batches with one cobas  Buffer Negative Control (BUF (-) C) (Roche, 07002238190) and one cobas  Positive Control (SARS-CoV-2 (+) C) (Roche, 09175440190).The assay utilizes two targets to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA: the SARS-CoV-2-specific ORF1ab gene and the pan-Sarbecovirus envelope E gene.All target results were valid across all 304 RPN pools tested.Optimized extraction of total RNA from poolsTotal RNA was extracted manually from 1 mL aliquots of each RPN pool positive for ORF1ab and/or E gene targets by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), utilizing the QIAamp UltraSens Virus Kit (Qiagen, 53706) and using an optimized protocol.Prior to extraction, all RPN pools were equilibrated to room temperature for at least 30 min.Briefly, 1 mL of the pooled viral transport medium was transferred to a 2 mL Dolphin Tube (Genesee Scientific, 24-284), lysed by adding 800 muL Buffer AC, and manually mixed by pipetting up and down.Carrier RNA (5.6 muL) was added to each tube and each mixture was vortexed one at a time.Lysates were incubated at room temperature for 10 min and spun at 5000 x g for 3 min.Tubes were opened and supernatants were removed from each tube within a biological safety cabinet.Lysates were moved to an isolated clean research space designated for nucleic acid extraction.A mixture of Buffer AR (300 muL) and proteinase K (20 muL) pre-warmed to 60  C was added to each lysate, which was then vortexed for 20 s. Lysates were incubated on a ThermoMixer C (Eppendorf, 2231000667) at 40  C, shaking at 2200 r.p.m.for 10 min.Lysates were then spun down and 300 muL Buffer AB was added to each tube.",11,20,0,0.57804644

121,"The RBD sequences of different SARS-CoV-2 strains that are circulating globally were initially thought to be conserved; however, with the availability of sequencing data several mutations have been reported.These findings emphasize the argument, that there may be correlation of the mutated strains circulating in a particular geographic setting with higher mortality rates and transmission patterns beside other combating factors.The mutation rate in ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses is intensely high which can be million times higher than that of their hosts and this results in virulence modulation and evolutionary capability for better viral adaptation.Genetic depiction of virus mutations can thus offer valuable insights for assessing the fitness of drug resistance, immune escapism, and pathogenesis.Due to its receptor binding property, the S protein is also supposed to be immunogenic and a putative target for developing the neutralizing antibodies and vaccines.It is reported that single-point mutations in the conserved amino acid residues in the RBD region completely abolishes the capacity of full-length S protein to induce neutralizing antibodies.Thus, virus mutation studies can be crucial for designing new vaccines and antiviral drugs.In this study, we aimed to predict the mutations in the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available in the database (whole genome sequences as well as partial coding sequences of spike protein) and analyze the effect of each mutation on the antigenicity of the predicted epitopes.This information may be helpful in predicting the transmission and infectivity of various SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating worldwide.Materials and MethodsSelection of SARS-CoV-2 Datasets Entrez Direct (EDirect) utilities were used to access the NCBI's nucleotide database by using in-house developed bash scripts to batch download the data.We used query keyword or phrase as ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" and ""spike coding sequences (CDS)"" by applying ESearch and EFetch utilities implemented in bash scripts to download the dataset for genome and spike proteins that were available till May 1, 2020.A total of 1,325 complete draft genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and additional 279 CDS having partial genomes coding spike protein (total 1,604 CDS of spike protein) were downloaded in FASTA format available globally from NCBI database ( Fig.1 ).SARS-COV-2 genome datasets from different countries available on NCBI till May 1, 2020.SARS-COV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.Multiple Sequence Alignment and Correlation of Genomic SNPs and Protein Mutations Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of all the 1,325 complete genome sequences as well as 1,604 CDS was performed using ClustalW-MPI with default parameters.Generated SNPs were identified by in-house developed bash scripts to batch process the data using Blade Server (Dell PowerEdge FC640 Server) with 256 GB RAM and 40 Core processor with 2.30 GHz.",2,6,0,0.675023

231,"However, donors with more than 10 donations (n = 30) had decay profiles similar to the whole cohort, in which donors stabilized at mid-low level, and none of these highly recurrent donors became seronegative (S2 Fig).Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 is correlated with Spike antibody levels and is maintained over timeThe neutralization capacity of these individual responses was assessed on a Spike-driven virus-cell fusion assay and a whole-virus neutralization assay (Fig 1A).Most sera were capable of inhibiting virus-cell fusion (82%, 68/83 ADAPT; 68%, 104/152 LIFE) and mediating viral neutralization (88%, 73/83 ADAPT; 94%, 143/152 LIFE) (Fig 2A, Table 2).In both cohorts, the virus-cell fusion assay was more stringent than the SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay as a proportion of individual sera with lower titers in the SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay were negative in the virus-cell fusion assay (7%, 6/83 ADAPT; 27%, 41/152 LIFE), and most individuals had higher titers in the neutralization assay (Fig 2A).To understand the discrepancy between both viral assays, live SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were enumerated and directly compared to Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles.Cell-permeable RNA-specific staining of live virions detected viral particles that were Nucleocapsid positive (Fig 2B).The particle to transduction ratios from the fusion assay were 1.03 x 105, consistent with the low specific infectivity of lentiviruses such as HIV-1.In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 particle to infectivity ranged from 58 (HekAT14) to 578 (VeroE6), consistent with the ratio reported for influenza virus.However, the absolute viral particle number was 74-fold higher in Spike-pseudotyped particle preparation (1.64 x 108 particles per ml) compared to authentic SARS-CoV-2 (2.22 x 106 particles per ml).Thus, the specific infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than that of Spike-expressing lentiviral particles, which may account for the higher sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2-based neutralization assay.Viral neutralization and inhibition of viral-cell fusion are strongly correlated with Spike antibody titers and sustained overtime.(A) 68%-82% of convalescent sera inhibited virus-cell fusion, whereas 88%-94% sera neutralized live authentic SARS-CoV-2.Neutralization titers were higher than viral-cell fusion titers in ADAPT (ns, not significant) and LIFE (P < 0.0001).(B) Approximately 75% of virus particles were SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid- and RNA positive (overlay, yellow).(C) All but one ADAPT patient had stable responses over time, whereas most LIFE donors (82%) had a decreased virus-cell fusion over time, with the majority (71%) exhibiting a single-phase decay.(D) In sera capable of viral neutralization, most ADAPT sera were stable (89%), whereas most LIFE sera (56%) had a decreased score over time, with the majority (75%) exhibiting a single-phase decay.",8,11,0,0.60111415
743,"While the first model is better in most cases, as seen in our research (Fig.4), lower-level models can also be better than higher-level models.If the I-TASSER simulations converge, less than 5 clusters can have been generated; it usually shows that because of the combined simulations, the models have good quality.Single amino acid variant (SAV), phenotype and mutation analysisSurface glycoprotein [Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2] with accession number YP_009724390.1 was used as a reference sequence to compare with, and it was downloaded from the link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/YP_009724390.1?report=fasta.Four Amino Acid Variants (SAV) were found from 20 spike glycoprotein sequences submitted and retrieved by a server available on the web called Phyre2.The Phyre2 is a user-friendly suite of bioinformatics tools that are available online to predict and analyze the structure, function, and mutations of proteins.At a particular position, color-coded bars of residue preference out of the 20 amino acids represent the Phyre2 mutational sensitivity results for any protein sequence, were tall red bars represent the highest favorable residues to have a phenotypic effect than shorter blue bars.The bar tallness is the values of the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) calculated by Position-Specific Iterated Basic Local Alignment (PSI-BLAST).ResultsSpike protein secondary structure by position-specific scoring matrices (PSIPRED)Spike protein secondary structure by position-specific scoring matrices (PSIPRED).The upper box shows the wild type D614 as a coil amino acid in light green color, and the lower box shows the G614 as an extracellular amino acid in orange color.(For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)Fig.1The prediction output of the secondary structure of the wild type spike glycoprotein versus the D614G variant showed that the substitution from D (aspartate) to G (glycine).D (aspartate) to G (glycine) has changed from a coil amino acid in the light green box to an extracellular amino acid in the orange box according to the color-coding of the PSIPRED, as shown in Fig.1.The final predicted model of the monomer of spike protein by I-TASSERAt first, it was not feasible to get the multimer (trimer) form of the spike protein, as the intricate building is one of the tool limitations of such kind of a computational model prediction.",5,40,1,0.5809455
181,"4f).This contrasted with robust induction of MIRb-ACE2 expression, particularly by IFNalpha (Fig.4f).Collectively, these data demonstrate that type I, II and III IFNs stimulate transcription of the ACE2 isoform driven by the alternative MIRb-LTR16A1, but not the canonical ACE2 promoter.The MIRb-ACE2 protein product is not stableThe MIRb-ACE2 isoform is predicted to encode a truncated ACE2 product (amino acids 357-805) and exonization exonization of the LTR16A1 element creates a novel 10 amino acid N-terminal sequence (MREAGWDKGG) in the putative translation product (Extended Data Fig.6).Importantly, this predicted protein lacks the first 356 amino acids, including the signal peptide, substrate-binding site and domains that interact with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (Extended Data Fig.6).Despite sharing the C-terminal half of full-length ACE2, which was readily detectable, endogenously produced MIRb-ACE2 protein was not detectable in SCC-4 and SCC-25 cells naturally expressing the MIRb-ACE2 transcript, by Western blotting using polyclonal anti-ACE2 antibodies (ab15348) (Fig.4e).To explore the protein-coding potential of the MIRb-ACE2 transcript, we cloned the coding sequences of both isoforms into the pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector and transfected HEK293T cells, which do not endogenously express ACE2 that would confound detection of ACE2 produced following transfection.While ACE2-transfected HEK293T cells produced detectable full-length ACE2, no protein of the predicted size was detectable in MIRb-ACE2-transfected cells (Extended Data Fig.7), in agreement with results using SCC-4 and SCC-25 cells (Fig.4e).In independently reported findings, endogenously produced MIRb-ACE2 protein could not be detected by Western blotting using the same polyclonal anti-ACE2 serum (ab15348).However, a Myc-DDK-tagged or GFP-tagged MIRb-ACE2 protein product was detected following overexpression in T24 cells in the same study.",7,9,0,0.54468733

128,"These replacements might influence the tertiary structure of the proteins and facilitate the increased virulence by escaping host immune response.The sequences in the HR1 (residues 902-952) and HR2 (residues 1,145-1,184) regions tend to form dimeric or trimeric helix bundles.As the S protein of coronavirus are homodimers or homotrimers, these HR regions may undergo oligomerization and result in the conformational change of S protein during virus-host cell fusion.These regions show different conformations in different fusion states and are known to be the most conserved among other regions in S protein of SARS-CoV.However, a previous study shows variations in HR1 domain which forms helical bundles with HR2 to facilitate fusion and entry of virus into the host and hypothesizes that the mutation A1168V in HR2 domain along with A930V mutation in HR1 domain confers peptide entry inhibitor resistance in mouse hepatitis coronaviruses.Hence the mutation A930V in HR1 domain and D1168H in HR2 domain found in our study might be relevant in explaining the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.With the rapid spread of this virus and limitation of specific therapy, studies are being focused on exploring the potential of neutralizing antibodies (as in plasma therapy) against vulnerable epitopes of S protein.Our study predicts some sequence-based epitopes conserved in all the spike proteins but with variable antigenicity ( Fig.3 ).ConclusionMost of the vaccines strategies against COVID-2 are focusing on the predicted epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.This protein is also proposed to be the most potent and specific drug target and for designing neutralizing antibodies.Our findings indicate that vaccine designing against SARS-CoV-2 could be a challenging task.Even though both RNA based, and peptide-based vaccines are being developed in more than seven laboratories, our observations may be useful in the efficacy analysis of these vaccine candidates.Authors' ContributionConflict of Interest P.K.S.contributed to the conceptualization, data curation, formal analysis, methodology, and original draft writing.U.K. contributed to the methodology, software, and original draft writing.S.B.R.contributed toward the methodology, resources, software, and original draft writing.S.R.M.worked toward the investigation methodology, resources, and original draft writing.S.S. did the conceptualization, funding acquisition, project administration, resources, supervision, writing review, and editing.P.K.S.",9,6,1,0.5693871
1162,"From the 1 L composite sample, 3 x 50 mL aliquots of sample were packaged in coolers containing ice packs and delivered to the University of Missouri within 24 h from collection.Concentration and recoveryNine samples in duplicate containing 50 mL of raw wastewater were stored at 4  C (18 total 50 mL samples).Raw samples were spun at 2000 xg for 5 min to remove large particulates, then vacuum filtered through a 0.22 mum filter (Millipore cat# SCGPOO525), mixed with a 50% (wt/v) Polyethylene glycol (PEG)(Research Products International (RPI) cat# P48080) and 1.2 M NaCl solution for a final concentration of 12% PEG and 0.3 M NaCl.NL4-3 derived HIV containing the CMV driven Puromycin resistance gene and lacking the accessory genes Vif, Vpr, Nef, and Env were added to the filtered sample/PEG/NaCl mixture at a concentration of 5.1 x 107 viral particles per sample (50 mL).Samples were mixed thoroughly and kept at 4  C for 1 h, then spun at 12,000 xg at 4  C for 2 h. All but 140 muL of supernatant was removed, and the entire volume was extracted for RNA purification.RNA was extracted from the samples using the Qiagen QIAmp Viral RNA mini kit (cat# 52906) in a QIAcube Connect (Qiagen cat# 9002864).Additionally, 140 muL of wastewater was collected prior to filtering the sample, after filtration (before addition of PEG solution); these samples were multiplied to be comparable to the full 50 mL volume.After concentration of virus.Viral recovery was determined by qPCR as described above.Importantly, for samples containing high copy numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material (>1.5 million copies/L), it was not necessary to concentrate samples, so for some experiments, unconcentrated wastewater was used to remove variables that may be introduced in concentration.Stability assessmentSix samples containing 50 mL of raw wastewater were stored at 4  C. Samples were mixed gently and split into 3 x 16.7 mL aliquots.Aliquots were stored at either 4  C, Room Temperature (RT) (~22  C), or 37  C for 24 h. After 24 h, 140 muL of sample was collected, RNA was extracted, and viral recovery was determined as previously described.As the samples had a concentration of SARS-CoV-2 signal over 1.5 million copies/L, the concentration step was not necessary and removed any further variables that would be introduced from this step.Statistics are a paired, two tailed Student's t-test run on Microsoft Excel.The function used was =t-test, array1, array2, tails, type where array1 and array2 are the values of each sample at each condition, respectively, and options for two tails and paired tests were selected.PasteurizationSix duplicate samples containing 50 mL of raw wastewater were stored at 4  C (12 total samples).One 50 mL tube of each duplicate sample was kept at 4  C, and the other 50 mL tube of sample was incubated at 60  C for 2 h then the entire sample was concentrated as described above.",5,66,0,0.6473124

918,"Furthermore, Verify3D analysis of the native and mutant proteins revealed that 95.38% (native) of the residues had an average 3D-1D score >= of 0.2, while the models (V160M, G181R, R240C, P335, G432, and D435) showed that 97.09%, 93.02%, 96.80%, 95.64%, 99.42%, and 94.19% of the residues have an average 3D-1D score >= 0.2.Besides, structural similarities between the wild-type and mutant structures were performed using TM-align tool based on TM-score to assess the topological similarity of two proteins and the RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) to measure the distance between the backbones of the superimposed protein structures.The RMSD values for all missense variants were significant (RMSD > 0.15), suggesting dissimilarity between wild-type and mutant models (Figure 4, Table 8).3.2.7.Ligand Binding Site PredictionTo identify ligand binding sites in the TMPRSS2 protein, we used RaptorX binding and COACH servers.According to the RaptorX binding tool, the largest pocket multiplicity was 55 (pocket multiplicity > 40 indicates a true prediction of the pocket), which binds to the residues H256, D435, S436, C437, Q438, G439, S441, T459, S460, W461, G462, S463, and G464 (Table 9).According to the COACH server, D435 was predicted as a binding residue.The detailed results of COACH are shown in Table 10.3.2.8.Protein DisplayThe topology prediction was shown by the Protter server; the figure illustrates a long cytoplasmic N-terminus and suggests that the TMPRSS2 protein was located mostly at the extracellular part of the cell membrane.Then, the five amino acids (orange color) represent the predicted variants such as V160, S254, E331, K451, and D491 (Figure 5).3.2.9.Dynamic Cross-Correlation Matrix Analysis Using Bio3d Package by RStudio Software and DynOmics ServerDCCM was done to comprehend the correlated communications between residues.The result showed that as compared with the wild type, the V160M, G181R, R240C, P335L, G432A, and D435Y variants decreased the degree of positive (red color) and negative (blue color) correlations observed in the TMPRSS2 native, despite the fact that no significant correlation in the movement of residues has been remarked in the Dynamic Cross-Correlation Matrix analysis (Figure 6, Table 11).4.DiscussionThe transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) plays a crucial role in human cell entry of a diverse range of viruses including SARS-CoV-2.Strikingly, a recent investigation by Hou et al.found six deleterious variants such as p. Val 160Met, p. Gly181Arg, p. Arg240Cys, p. Pro335Leu, p. Gly432Ala, and p. Arg435Tyr in the TMPRSS2 gene, which are demonstrated as somatic mutations in different cancer databases and also suggest explanations for genetic susceptibility to COVID-19.This analysis reported that TMPRSS2 variants were probably associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.",11,50,0,0.5990776

182,"In independently reported findings, endogenously produced MIRb-ACE2 protein could not be detected by Western blotting using the same polyclonal anti-ACE2 serum (ab15348).However, a Myc-DDK-tagged or GFP-tagged MIRb-ACE2 protein product was detected following overexpression in T24 cells in the same study.Moreover, a separate study reported detection of the putative MIRb-ACE2 protein in primary nasal epithelial cells by Western blotting using the same polyclonal anti-ACE2 serum (ab15348), raising the possibility that the protein can indeed be translated.To explain the apparent inefficiency of protein production from MIRb-ACE2 transcripts, we cloned the coding sequences of both isoforms into the pcDNA3.1-DYK-P2A-GFP expression vector, which adds both a FLAG tag and P2A peptide-linked GFP as part of the protein product.Expression of GFP was comparable in ACE2-transfected and MIRb-ACE2-transfected cells, suggesting that the single RNA molecule that encodes for both the FLAG-tagged MIRb-ACE2 product and GFP is stable and translated (Fig.5a).Despite that, following transfection with plasmid concentrations producing readily detectable full-length ACE2 and resulting in MIRb-ACE2 RNA levels comparable with those endogenously produced in IFNalpha-stimulated cells, we could not detect the predicted MIRb-ACE2 protein with antibodies to the FLAG tag (Fig.5b).However, the FLAG tagged MIRb-ACE2 protein could be detected in HEK293T cells transfected with much higher plasmid concentrations, resulting in RNA expression levels which were one order of magnitude higher than those observed in IFNalpha-stimulated NHBE, SCC-4 or SCC2-25 cells (Fig.5c).Therefore, although the MIRb-ACE2 transcript is efficiently translated (supported by the levels of P2A-linked GFP), the MIRb-ACE2 protein product is much less abundant than the full-length ACE2 at a given RNA transcription level, suggesting post-translational protein instability of the former.Lysine residues 625 and 702 in the full-length ACE2 protein have been described to be ubiquitinated and may contribute to its proteosomal degradation.We generated a K625R K702R (K2R) mutant of full-length ACE2, which increased protein levels, compared to the wild-type ACE2 (Fig.5d).We have introduced the same mutations in the corresponding residues of the predicted MIRb-ACE2 protein product, K279R K356R, which were similarly accessible for ubiquitination (Extended Data Fig.8).However, we were unable to detect stable protein following transfection with the MIRb-ACE2 K2R-encoding mutant (Fig.5d).",8,9,1,0.6109176

724,"If and how these may affect RNA-binding remains to be investigated.Structural protein ion channel envelope protein (E-protein)The integral membrane E-protein is the smallest of the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins (75 residues).It plays important roles in virus-like particle production and maturation.Coronavirus E-proteins are co-translationally inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to Golgi complexes.Although it is abundantly expressed within the cell, only a modest number of copies are incorporated into the viral envelope (estimated number/virion~20 for SARS-CoV-1,).Instead, most of the protein participates in virion assembly and budding together with the SARS-CoV-2 integral membrane M-protein (also a virion structural protein).Additional functions of the E-protein are thought to include preventing M-protein aggregation and inducing membrane curvature.Recombinant coronaviruses lacking E-proteins display weakened maturation, reduced viral titers, or yield incompetent progeny, highlighting its role in maintaining virion integrity.The E-protein consists of a shorter hydrophilic N-terminal segment, a longer hydrophobic transmembrane domain (TMD), and a hydrophilic C-terminal domain.An amphipathic -helix within the TMD oligomerizes into an homopentameric arrangement perpendicular to the plane of the lipid bilayer forming an ion-conducting viroporin.Residues lining the pore include N15, L19, A22, F26, T30, I33, and L37.The NMR structure of the SARS-CoV-1 E-protein (PDB ID 5X29) served as the template for generating the computed structural model of the SARS-CoV-2 E-protein that was used for analyzing its evolution in 3D (Figure 13).The N-terminal seven residues and the C-terminal ten residues were omitted from the homology model, because they were not reported in the SARS-CoV-1 NMR structure.(A) Space-filling representation of the computed structural model of the E-protein with individual protomers shown with shades of pink and purple.(B) Ribbon representation with each protomer shown using a different color viewed parallel to the membrane (left, membrane shown, N- and C-termini labeled) and down the five-fold axis from the virion surface (right).(C) Pore-lining substitutions L37R and L37H compared to L37 in the reference sequence (residue 37 is shown in a color-coded space-filling representation; C-gray; O-red; N-blue)Overall substitution trends for the E-protein and energetics analysis results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.S68F (nonconservative, structural location unknown) is the most common USV, observed 107 times in the GISAID dataset.",36,39,0,0.64753705
1587,"However, the mutation that will be responsible for the spread and effects of the virus in the upcoming period may be among one or more of the SNVs currently seen below 10% frequency.In Figure 6, association between 102 SNVs, which are harboured at least 2% of all isolates including the 38 SNVs, was analysed in detail in the present study.The relationship between SNVs should be considered in two directions as shown in an example: isolates harbouring any of the 102 SNVs also harbour the C241T variation, but isolates carrying C241T have over 20% association with only 27 out of 102 SNVs.The association between 102 SNVs has been ranked from 0 to 1 and heat-mapped to be easily traceable (0: red, 1: green) (Figure 6).The association data in Figure 6 emerged as a result of analyses performed in this study may present significant observations in terms of monitoring mutations.ConclusionThe current study is remarkable in terms of the number of SARS-CoV-2 genome analysed in an academic publication.In the past 18 months, the pandemic continues unabated.During this time, the genomic sequence data from SARS-CoV-2 isolates exceeded 1 M submissions, and it is obvious that this number will be higher by the time of writing this paper.Analyses performed in this study present a genomic chronicle for the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence.",10,91,0,0.6792304
1048,"Whether or not SARS-CoV-2 infection induces long-term protective immunity remains an open question, and we have to wait several months before knowing if current vaccines allow establishing herd immunity.Closely related with the immunity issue is the puzzling observation of persistent viral shedding detectable in real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, even after symptom resolution.Usually, SARS-CoV-2 viral load peaks in the first week of illness, compared with 10-14 days for SARS-CoV and 7-10 days for MERS-CoV.However, long shedding cases are not rare, and a survey of 378 Covid-19 patients from Wuhan revealed that 36 continued to shed the virus longer than 30 days (mean of 54 days; longest 83 days).This extended or recurrent positivity could be due to (1) a reactivation of the virus after a period of clinical latency; (2) SARS-CoV-2 reinfection; (3) or simply RT-PCR tests detecting viral remains and not necessarily active viral particles.To untangle between the two first possibilities, it is necessary to perform viral whole-genome sequencing and detect genetically distinct lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in each of the disease episodes; of course, reinfections by the same lineage may remain unnoticed.To check for the last possibility, the inclusion of infectivity studies might help understand if the virus retains both viability and integrity.It is becoming evident that for most SARS-CoV-2 infection cases, in common with the related SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses, the duration of viable viruses is short, despite long shedding.At the moment, a few molecularly proven SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic reinfections have been published worldwide, namely in Hong-Kong, Belgium, Ecuador, and the USA.After being considered recovered, these four patients presented a second infection by a genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineage after a 48 to 142-day intervening period.The latter two patients displayed a more severe disease in the second episode, which is in accordance to the hypothesis of an antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) to SARS-CoV-2.The number of reinfection cases must be higher than currently reported, as they are easily missed when asymptomatic.So far, two asymptomatic reinfections were detected in Indian healthcare workers, whom were routinely screened in their workplace.Although these two cases were asymptomatic in the first and second infections, the viral load was higher in the second one, as inferred from the RT-PCR cycle threshold.Another theoretical possibility is the occurrence of reinfection while the first infection was not yet cured, which is a situation best described as co-infection.",1,58,0,0.5088686

Table S1).Notably, many of these studies used a modified version of the CDC assay that did not report a LoD.Furthermore, of the studies that report the CT values of their results, no viral-load conversion was provided, which is important since different RT-PCR assays and platforms have unique conversions between CT value and viral load.Therefore, we were unable to systematically compare nasal-swab performance at low viral loads in these reports.These differences left open the possibility that inconsistent comparative performance of nasal-swab sampling might be explained largely by differences in assay LoD, and possibly also by patient viral load.Nasal-swab sampling protocols and transport medium conditions varied between studies; there was no obvious correlation between concordance and whether specimens were collected by the subjects themselves or by health care workers, or the relative timing of collection.Nasal swab studies with >=30 SARS-CoV-2-positive subjectsStudy Samplesa Collection procedure Self-collected or health care worker-collected Nasal and NP swabs collected simultaneously No.",8,5,0,0.56268305

1604,"Mice that received immune serum showed no signs of weight loss or ill health following inoculation of CoV-2 (Fig.6G).DiscussionIn an endeavor to optimize the synthesis and immunogenicity of S, the major target of CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, we constructed a panel of rMVAs that expressed unmodified and modified versions of S. A common feature of all the rMVAs was good surface expression of the RBD as shown by interaction with an anti-RBD mAb and soluble hACE2.Each of the rMVAs induced neutralizing antibodies (NT50 of 103 or higher) that compared favorably with that achieved by mRNA immunizations in mice and in a phase 1 clinical trial using the same lentivirus pseudovirus CoV-2 neutralization protocol and reagents.Neutralizing antibody was detected in mice at 1 wk after vaccination, peaked at 3 wk, and persisted for at least 7 wk.In some experiments, rMVA Tri containing S with proline stabilizing mutations, inactivation of the furin cleavage site, and deletion of the ERRS elicited slightly higher neutralizing antibody than other rMVAs after a single immunization, but larger numbers of mice would be needed to confidently assess superiority.Isotype analysis indicated that the rMVAs induced a well-balanced predominantly Th1-type response to S with IgG2a or IgG2c (depending on the mouse strain) > IgG2b > IgG1 > IgG3, which is the usual order following a viral infection and by IFNgamma stimulation.IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG2c have similar functions and are able to fix complement and also activate Fc receptors to promote virus clearance, whereas IgG1 may limit inflammation.Lower levels of binding and neutralizing antibodies were detected following priming and boosting with purified soluble RBD protein in QS-21 adjuvant.IgG1 was predominant when mice were immunized with the adjuvanted RBD protein, even though more balanced IgG1 and IgG2 responses have been reported using other immunogens with QS-21.Nevertheless, the predominance of IgG2a and IgG2c was maintained and the levels increased when RBD protein was used as the boost for rMVAs, suggesting that the protein stimulated an anamnestic response.The trade-off of boosting with RBD protein, however, was a lower CD8+IFNgamma+ T cell response.Vaccine protection studies were carried out with transgenic K18-hACE2 mice, which exhibit fatal respiratory infection following IN administration of CoV-2.Two rMVAs were selected for immunization: one (2P) expressed full-length S with the two proline substitutions like that used in other vaccines studies, and the other (Tri) had two additional modifications.Mice were primed with the rMVAs and boosted with the homologous rMVA or adjuvanted RBD protein.Each of the four vaccination protocols successfully prevented weight loss and morbidity.No infectious CoV-2 was recovered from the lungs, and cytokine and chemokine levels were severely reduced.Nevertheless, low amounts of subgenomic N and S mRNAs were detected in the nasal turbinates of some mice at 2 d after challenge, indicating that abortive CoV-2 replication occurred.",14,92,1,0.56251466

653,"Figure adapted from data published in Peng et al.(2017) with permission from Cell Press, see manuscript for further details.Since the initial adaptation of H3N2 viruses to human-type receptors, they have circulated in the human population for over 50 years and over time have drifted to a more restricted receptor-binding specificity.This has become particularly evident during the last decade, where H3N2 isolates have proved increasingly difficult to recover in laboratory hosts and failed to hemagglutinate erythrocytes in standard hemagglutination titer assays.In several reports, H3N2 viruses isolated after 2003 were found to bind poorly to alpha2-6-linked sialoside receptors on glycan arrays and other solid-phase binding assays, leading to the conclusion that these viruses had lost specificity for human-type receptors.However, it subsequently became apparent that later H3N2 strains retained strong specificity for human-type receptors, but bound preferentially to a subset of extended sialic acid alpha2-6-linked glycans with additional N-acetyllactosamine (Galbeta1-4GlcNAc) repeat sequences.HAs from these viruses appeared to lose binding to human-type receptors as a result of substantial but selective loss of avidity for ""short"" alpha2-6 glycans including the sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine trisaccharide (NeuAcalpha2-6Galbeta1-4GlcNAc), commonly used in laboratory-based receptor assays (Fig.5).This restricted specificity of the H3 HA for only a subset of human-type receptors has had significant impact on influenza research and vaccine development since it coincided with, and likely directly contributed to, the inability of more recent H3N2 strains to propagate efficiently in laboratory hosts such as MDCK cells and eggs.Furthermore, poor binding to erythrocytes used in hemagglutination and HAI assays to measure virus titers and determine inhibitory potency of antibodies in serum, respectively, has proved an equally significant limitation even when potential vaccine strains can be grown successfully.Mismatches in receptor specificity of IAVs for their natural receptors in humans and receptors present in laboratory hosts are not new, having been described in 1949 by Burnet upon passage of H1N1 viruses in eggs resulting in a switch from the ""O"" (original) to ""D"" (derived) specificity, as measured by acquisition of hemagglutination with chicken erythrocytes.For recent H3N2 viruses, specificity mismatches are particularly consequential since commercial vaccines are produced in eggs, and primary H3N2 isolates grow poorly in these hosts due to the absence of extended alpha2-6 sialic acid receptors found in humans.Indeed, it is well documented that N-linked glycans found on cells lining the amniotic membrane of chicken eggs contain both human type (alpha2-6) and avian type (alpha2-3) sialic acid linkages; however, these receptors are found exclusively on short trisaccharide extensions attached to the Man3GlcNAc2Asn core.",11,37,0,0.68989724
659,"Furthermore, WHO data shows there has been a substantial reduction of H5N1 human infections since 2015 to 2016, thus strongly reducing the potential for such evolution to occur and likely lowering the risk of a new pandemic.H7N9Human infections with avian H7N9 viruses were first reported in 2013 and, similar to H5N1, have been strongly associated with acute exposure to infected live poultry.Despite only recent appearance, human H7N9 infections have spread rapidly, with over 1500 confirmed cases and over 600 deaths worldwide between 2013 and 2019 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai-20190830.pdf?sfvrsn=30d65594_34, https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-september-2018-ah7n9-china/en/, June 2020).Also similarly to H5N1, zoonotic avian H7N9 isolates from human patients have typically retained strong binding to alpha2-3-linked receptors, suggesting only poor or partial adaptation to human hosts; however, given the rapid spread of human cases, and prior reports that H7 genes in alternate subtypes, including H7N7 and H7N2, can bind strongly to human receptors, close attention has been paid to circulating H7N9 strains due to the possibility of heightened pandemic potential.H7N9 strains have entered the human population through a series of seasonal epidemic outbreaks or ""waves,"" with the most severe fifth wave in 2017 featuring the largest number of cases, widest geographic spread, and emergence of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) strains.Emphasizing both the significance of the outbreak and growing global resources and research maturity in the influenza field, analyses of early first-wave H7N9 strains were particularly rapid, with numerous high-quality studies published within months of the first human infections.Early viral isolates were shown to contain numerous high-risk variants, including PB2 E627K (enhanced polymerase activity/virulence in mammals), NA R294K (oseltamivir resistance), and HA G186V and Q226L (receptor specificity switch mutations associated with pandemic viruses).Despite containing HA adaptive variants, solid-phase binding assays, including glycan microarrays, demonstrated early human H7N9 strains to have mixed receptor specificity and, in most cases, retained strong predominant binding to avian alpha2-3 receptors.Several crystal structures in complex with both avian and human receptor fragments revealed receptor-binding modes most in common with avian-adapted HAs, with human receptor cocomplexes showing a noncanonical conformation for the receptor glycan when compared with human HA counterparts.Pathogenesis studies revealed that while new H7N9 viruses did appear well adapted for infection and replication in various mammalian hosts, including mice, ferrets, pigs, and nonhuman primates, most isolates could not be efficiently transmitted via airborne respiratory droplets in the ferret model (typically only one out of three recipients) and were therefore unlikely to lead to significant human-to-human transmission.Since first-wave 2013 strains, H7N9 viruses have continued to circulate, becoming enzootic in birds and causing sporadic human infections in seasonal epidemic waves with little significant change in viral properties until a fifth epidemic in 2017 that led to the emergence of HPAI H7N9.",17,37,0,0.5351443

Virus-serum mix was then added onto ACE2-HEK293T cells (2.5 x 103/well) in a 384-well plate.Following spinoculation at 1,200g for 1 hour at 18 C, the cells were moved to 37 C for 72 hours.Entry of Spike particles was imaged by GFP-positive cells (InCell Analyzer) followed by enumeration with InCarta software (Cytiva, USA).Uninfected cells were run in parallel to account for background fluorescence signal.In infected cells, Spike-driven entry of lentiviral particles resulted in strong GFP expression, while the uninfected controls were negative for GFP (S8A and S8B Fig).Neutralization was measured by reduction in GFP expression relative to control group infected with the virus particles without any serum treatment.Serum dilution resulting in 50% reduction in GFP expression relative to the infected control was used to determine virus-cell fusion inhibition titers (S8B and S8C Fig).The cutoff of positivity for virus-cell fusion inhibition was 1:40.Accordingly, fusion inhibition was considered as absent when titers were below 1:40.Pre-pandemic healthy control sera (Privigen USA, P100103528, 2091200221, P100007516) showed no fusion inhibition and hence no reduction in GFP expression, thus confirmimg the specificity of the assay (S8C Fig).",24,11,1,0.6922322

422,"2).In order to place these genomes on a timed tree reconstruction, we conservatively used the week ending date of each pool.All RPN SARS-CoV-2 genomes were identified in specimens collected in the last week of February (ending on 29 February) and the first week of March (ending on 7 March), a time period when molecular diagnostic testing still was limited to individuals fulfilling a very narrow range of testing criteria.The sequences from these early infections map to four different PANGO lineages, B.1 (n = 4), B.1.5 (n = 1), B.2.12 (n = 1), and A.2 (n = 1), consistent with multiple independent introductions (Fig.2c, Supplementary Fig.2, and Table 1).All four lineages were detected subsequently during the peak in the spring of 2020 in NYC, which was dominated by the B.1 lineage.Notably, the B.1 RPN pools (P134, P41, P58, and P53) are nested within a cluster that was linked to the early community spread of SARS-CoV-2 in NYC, delineated by the additional substitutions ORF3a-Q57H and ORF1a-T265I.Global SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data between January and March 2020 is scarce, making it difficult to fully resolve the relationships between community spread and additional introductions during the early period of the outbreak in NYC.Lineage B.1 is a parent lineage to multiple emerging lineages that continue to circulate in the US, including lineage B.1.2 (N:P67S), which has become a dominant lineage in the US (NextStrain build, 17 February 2021, https://nextstrain.org/ncov).DiscussionTaken together, we provide clear evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infections were present in NYC at least 6 to 8 weeks prior to the surge of cases that flooded the NYC health system.Previous studies have suggested cryptic transmissions weeks prior to the first confirmed cases of community spread.Large retrospective testing efforts have probed for SARS-CoV-2 in banked nasopharyngeal specimens from at least seven states (Michigan, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin, Washington State, and California), with the earliest positive specimens dating back to 21 February 2020 (Seattle, WA and California).In addition, a recent serosurvey of blood products further suggests early undetected spread in multiple states across the US from December 2019 through January 2020.Of note, these studies relied solely on molecular testing without validation by viral genome sequencing.",7,20,0,0.58333355

1606,"MVA can be administered orally, IN, and by aerosol, and the IN route has been shown to stimulate bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue and serum IgA.Even though IM administration of the rMVA CoV-2 S vaccines greatly reduced and rapidly eliminated virus replication in the nasal turbinates, IN administration might have a greater ability to reduce CoV-2 spread.Nevertheless, complete prevention of viral replication may prove difficult, as low amounts of viral RNA were still detected in the turbinates when an adenovirus vector expressing CoV-2 S was inoculated IN.We showed that RBD and full-length S protein can boost antibody responses as well as or slightly better than an rMVA boost.There is precedent for other heterologous prime-boost systems in which MVA is teamed up with nucleic acids and other virus vectors, providing another potential vaccine strategy to combat COVID-19.After submission of our manuscript for review, two related studies were posted online in advance of publication and as a preprint.In both studies, rMVA vectors that expressed unmodified full-length CoV-2 S induced neutralizing antibodies and protected mice that expressed hACE-2 from infection with CoV-2.Limitations of Study.K18-hACE2 transgenic mice are imperfect models of human susceptibility to CoV-2, and the virus inoculum, which caused severe morbidity and death within 5 d to 6 d, is likely higher than occurs during human transmission.The lack of signs of morbidity, failure to detect infectious CoV-2 in the lungs, and reduced levels of cytokines and chemokines in the lungs of vaccinated mice are consistent with the prevention of pathology, although the latter was not evaluated by pulmonary function tests or histological examination.Materials and MethodsDetailed procedures and sources of reagents are described in SI Appendix.Mice.The 5- to 6-wk-old female BALB/cAnNTac and C57BL/6ANTac mice were obtained from Taconic Biosciences, and B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories.Construction of Recombinant Viruses.DNA encoding the CoV-2 S protein (QHU36824.1), with a C-terminal 3xFLAG tag and modified by silent mutations for enhanced expression and stability in MVA, was chemically synthesized.Another construct (Tri) with the proline substitutions (K986P/V987P), furin recognition site substitutions (aa 682 to 685 RRAR to GSAS), and C-terminal 19-aa deletion of ERRS was also synthesized.Constructs with these single mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis.",16,92,0,0.61145186
657,"One significant example of this is found in H7N9, where, in recent (particularly fourth and fifth) waves, human isolates of avian viral infections have been found to be highly dominant for the Q226L mutation associated with ""humanized"" receptor specificity in both H2N2 and H3N2 pandemics.However, various studies working both in vitro and in vivo have now demonstrated that the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission, measured by proxy either through airborne infections in the ferret model or through conversion to human receptor specificity on glycan microarrays, is likely both complex and individual to different subtypes, requiring distinct combinations of multiple different adaptive mutations.In this section, we review current knowledge on likely adaptations to support human transmission in prominent avian virus subtypes, as well as evidence for potential selection in nature.H5N1Current H5N1 strains emerged in avian species in China in the mid-1990s and are both highly contagious and extremely pathogenic in birds.Initial human H5N1 cases were detected in 1997, and WHO now reports over 860 documented human H5N1 infections between 2003 and 2019, with a mortality rate of approximately 50% (https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/H5N1_cumulative_table_archives/en/, June 2020), leading to heightened concern about a potential pandemic (by comparison, 1918 pandemic H1N1 estimated case mortality is only approximately 10%).Fortunately, however, most human H5N1 infections to date have been associated with acute exposure to live poultry, and zoonotic strains have shown very limited adaptation for human receptor binding or human-to-human transmission, despite persistent low-frequency introductions for more than two decades.Potential for an H5 pandemic has thus prompted great research into circulating viral mutants that might confer human adaptation, particularly within HA.To date, natural variants with potential to alter receptor specificity have been reported at more than 20 individual H5 amino acid positions, with many more combinations of both natural and engineered mutants also studied (reviewed in detail in ref.).Thus far, however, no naturally occurring H5N1 viruses (whether human or avian isolates) have demonstrated the strong alpha2-6 receptor specificity associated with pandemic outbreaks or sustained human-to-human transmission.While natural H5 variants at numerous positions, including 133, 137, 138, 144, 155, 186, 187, 190, 192, 193, 196, and 197 (all H3 numbering), do appear to increase binding to human-type receptors, all examined isolates have been shown to retain equal or dominant binding to alpha2-3-linked glycans, suggestive of only partial adaptation.In vitro protein engineering studies using recombinant H5s, together with in vivo experiments aimed at directly evolving H5N1 viruses, have shown that the pathway toward full ""humanization,"" resulting in either fully altered receptor specificity or full airborne transmission in ferrets, is in fact quite complex and requires multiple adaptive changes.",15,37,0,0.5331963

1571,"The latter has been linked to greater transmissibility and pathogenicity, and currently the L lineage has diverged into the GISAID L, V, G, GH, and GR clades.In this study, by sequencing and phylogenetically characterizing SARS-CoV-2 viruses in Ghana, we have shown that locally circulating SARS-CoV-2 appears to exhibit a lower evolutionary rate than observed elsewhere.We have identified 17 genotypes with evidence of transmissible variants (~9 variants).Most variants appear to have spread from the Greater Accra Region to the Central and Western regions of Ghana, with Ayawaso in East Legon as a likely epicenter.The locally sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses demonstrated very little variation from the original Wuhan strain, a common characteristic of this virus.Ten of the initial 15 viral genomes were closely linked to the European superclade A.Most genomes (8/15) clustered to 20 A, B, C/G, GR, GH/A2a; half of these had no history of travel, while the remaining genomes were from travelers from Hungary, India, USA (via Dubai) and the UK.Notably, all five of the batch 1 genomes that clustered to clade B4 had no evidence of travel or direct contact with a recent traveler, which is evidence of local transmission linked to the Asian superclade B.Though these initial genomes from March-April 2020 suggest ongoing local transmission in Ghana, the relative lack of variation suggested that most locally transmitted viruses were less than one month old, indicating a recent introduction and nascent expansion (late February/early March, 2020) of the virus into Ghana.We have identified a total of seven potential circulating genotypes of 19B/S/B4 as well as three apparently transmissible locally evolved genotypes GHA (ORF1a- L681F; ORF8- L84S; N- S202N; ORF14- V49I), GHC (ORF1a- M3665H; ORF8- L84S, E92K; N- S202N; ORF14- A26V, V49I), and GHD (ORF1a- M3665H; ORF8- L84S, E92K; N- S202N; ORF14- A26V, V49I; S- I805M).We have identified 12 likely circulating genotypes of Legacy clade A2a viruses.Our data show evidence of multiple importations of A2a viruses intoGhana, and apparent ongoing transmission within essential personnel in Accra (Greater Accra Region), Cape Coast (Central Region), Tarkwa and Sekondi-Takoradi (Western Region).Eleven genomes in our batch 2 sequencing round appeared to be linked; most were isolated from essential personnel in the Greater Accra, Central, and Western Regions.This suggests the patients might have contracted the infection from a single source early in the outbreak; likely during the lockdown.",15,90,1,0.59955585

706,"These three cleavage events liberate nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3.The PLPro portion of nsp3 is also implicated in cleaving post-translational modifications of ubiquitin (Ub) and ISG15 domains of host proteins as an evasion mechanism against host antiviral immune responses.PLPro is a cytoplasmic cysteine endopeptidase (EC 3.4.22.69) that catalyzes cleavage of the peptide bond C-terminal to LXGG motifs (where X is any amino acid) in the viral polyproteins.This enzyme also recognizes conserved LRGG motifs found within the C-terminal segments of Ub and ISG15 proteins.According to the MEROPS classification, PLPro belongs to the peptidase clan CA (family C16), containing a Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad (C111-H272-D286).The first structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLPro to be made public (PDB ID 6W9C) revealed a symmetric homotrimer with each enzyme monomer being highly similar to that of SARS-CoV-1 PLPro (PDB ID 2FE8; r.m.s.d.~ 0.8 A, sequence identity~83%).Since PDB release of this initial SARS-CoV-2 PLPro structure, additional co-crystal structures of PLPro with a variety of ligands have been deposited to the PDB (list updated weekly at http://rcsb.org/covid19).In many of these structures, the enzyme is monomeric, indicating that the trimer observed in PDB ID 6W9C is almost certainly a crystal packing artifact.Comparison of the various PLPro monomer structures reveals that the enzyme does not undergo large conformational changes upon binding of inhibitors or (protein) substrates (Figure 6A).We, therefore, used the structure of an inhibited form of the enzyme (PDB ID 6WUU) for evolutionary analyses of PLPro (Figure 6A).(A) Space-filling representation of the experimental structure of the PLPro monomer (blue) bound to a covalent inhibitor (Vir250; red/pink) (PDB ID 6WUU).(B) Ribbon/atomic stick figure representation of the PLPro-ISG15 interface (PDB ID 6YVA).Oxygen atoms are shown in red, nitrogens in blue, and sulfurs in yellow.Cartoons and carbons are gray for ISG15, purple for substituted PLPro interfacial residues, and cyan for all other PLPro residues.",18,39,0,0.6309379
546,"Conversely, antibodies developed through natural infection or vaccines may impose selection pressure on beta-CoVs.For these and other reasons, it is imperative to understand the biological properties of beta-CoVs that contribute to the emergence of new strains and species.Virus variation, evolution, and adaptation to diverse hosts are mediated by genetic determinants in the viral genome and selection pressure imposed by the host.Accordingly, characterization of genomic variation is fundamental to our understanding of beta-CoV evolution and host adaptation.We hypothesized that genetic determinants of variation in beta-CoVs are conserved across species, including SARS-CoV-2.In this study, we profiled the genomic variation in all species in the genus Betacoronavirus.Genome-wide nucleotide variation analyses combined with amino acid variation analyses revealed that variation patterns are conserved across beta-CoVs, including the presence of variable areas at homologous locations.The most variable parts are the S glycoprotein, followed by open reading frame 8, accessory proteins 3 and 7, and the N protein.Genome-wide distribution of mutations of all beta-CoVs provides an explanation for the emergence of new beta-CoV species, such as SARS-CoV-2, and for the emergence of strains.These findings and published results predict how and where SARS-CoV-2 will accumulate mutations and differentiate into new biological strains.SARS-CoV-2 will likely evolve as it adapts to genetically diverse human populations and possibly to selection constraints imposed by vaccines, antiviral drugs, and antibodies developed against natural infections.Our results underscore the potential for the continual emergence of new beta-CoV species and strains with novel biological properties.RESULTSS glycoprotein is more variable than the rest of the genome.SARS-CoV-2 strains identified to date differ in the accumulation of nonsynonymous substitutions in the entire genome (Fig.1A).However, nonsynonymous substitutions preferentially accumulate in the S glycoprotein and in the N protein.In all other parts of the genome, mutations accumulate to a frequency that is equal to or less than that expected randomly (Fig.1B).New mutations continue to arise and diversify SARS-CoV-2 into variants.However, recurrent mutations mapped along the SARS-CoV-2 genome preferentially accumulate in the S glycoprotein.Amino acid substitutions in UK, South Africa, and Brazil SARS-CoV-2 strains.(A) Location of amino acid mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 genome.Coordinates are based on accession no.NC_045512.2.(B) Proportion of amino acid substitutions observed and randomly expected based on the length of each protein or open reading frame.Strains are color coded.To further test preferential accumulation of mutations in the S glycoprotein, we measured single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome and separately in the S glycoprotein, normalized to their respective length.SARS-CoV was included in the analysis as it was closely related to SARS-CoV-2.",4,28,0,0.57901675

1166,"To test the effect on signal due to pasteurization, duplicate samples were kept at either 4  C or 60  C for 2 h prior to RNA extraction (Fig.2A).We found no significant difference between pasteurized and non-pasteurized samples (P value = 0.23) when RNA was extracted immediately after pasteurization; however, it is important to note that signal dropped significantly if samples were returned to 4  C after pasteurization and RNA was collected 24-36 h after pasteurization was completed (Fig.2B).A 24-36-hour period between pasteurization resulted in a 44% reduction in signal (P value = 2.05 x 10-6).Additionally, in a separate experiment, when samples were frozen at -80  C for 36 h and thawed prior to concentration, over 90% of the SARS-CoV-2 signal was lost (Fig.2C).SARS-CoV-2 signal is higher than enveloped virus controlA) Schematic of Puro Virus Control.NL4-3 derived HIV containing CMV driven, uniquely codon optimized, Puromycin resistance and lacking the accessory genes Vif, Vpr, Nef, and Env.B) Relative Recovery of Puro Virus Signal and SARS-CoV-2 Signal.Samples were spiked with Puro Virus at a concentration of 5.1 x 107 viral particles per sample.RNA was extracted from samples both before and after concentration, and viral recovery was determined by qPCR.C-F) Parameters at time of Collection in Relation to Control Recovery C) N = 68.Temperature D) N = 97 pH value E) N = 84.COD F) N = 69. log TSS value of wastewater at the end of 24-hour composite sample collection.R2 values for linear regression lines are 0.0081, 0.01, 0.0172, and 0.0371, respectively.Fig.3As a control throughout wastewater screening, an NL4-3 derived HIV virus containing a CMV driven Puromycin resistance gene and lacking the accessory genes Vif, Vpr, Nef, and Env (Henceforth called 'Puro Virus') was added to raw wastewater samples at a concentration of 5.1 x 107 viral particles per sample (Fig.3A).Importantly, the Puro Virus contains a uniquely codon optimized puromycin resistance gene.This vector was chosen because the unique sequence present in the Puro Virus ensures that any signal detected throughout our experiments with this probe is from our internal matrix control and not the environment ensuring that nothing environmental will be amplified in our control.Additionally, Both SARS-CoV-2 and the Puro Virus are positive-sense RNA contained in an envelope at a similar size.",9,66,0,0.62277627
183,"However, we were unable to detect stable protein following transfection with the MIRb-ACE2 K2R-encoding mutant (Fig.5d).Consistent with this, the addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 was sufficient to increase protein levels of ACE2, but did not rescue the MIRb-ACE2 protein product (Fig.5d).Moreover, cycloheximide treatment of HEK293T cells transfected with FLAG tagged ACE2 or MIRb-ACE2 constructs led to the rapid loss of MIRb-ACE2 protein, but did not affect levels of full-length ACE2 in the same time frame (Fig.5e), further supporting reduced stability of the former.Structural considerations suggested that the MIRb-ACE2 protein product would unlikely retain the partial structure of the canonical ACE2 peptidase fold, as removing most of the this subdomain would expose the remaining component of the highly charged substrate-binding groove as well as large parts of the hydrophobic protein core (Extended Data Fig.9).Hence, it seems unlikely that a protein coded by the MIRb-ACE2 transcript would form a structure similar to that of the canonical ACE2.Moreover, the MIRb-ACE2 protein product lacks a canonical signal peptide and when an IgG kappa chain-derived signal peptide, which has been successfully used to express the canonical ACE2 ectodomain (residues 15-615), was fused to the corresponding domain of the predicted MIRb-ACE2 protein (residues 1-269), there was no detectable secreted protein.These data suggest that the latter protein is subject to post-translational degradation through a proteasome-independent mechanism and therefore unlikely to exert significant biological activity.Nevertheless, as the MIRb-ACE2 protein was indeed made under certain conditions, it remained possible that it retained some biological function or that it affected the function of canonical ACE2 through heterodimer formation.To examine this possibility, we quantified levels of enzymatically active ACE2, an assay that is considerably more sensitive than Western blotting, and found, as expected, strong enzymatic activity in lysates from ACE2-transfected, but not MIRb-ACE2-transfected cells (Fig.5f).Furthermore, co-transfection with MIRb-ACE2 did not affect the enzymatic activity conferred by ACE2 transfection (Fig.5f).To determine any involvement of the predicted MIRb-ACE2 protein in SARS-CoV-2 entry, we measured binding of the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, the first step of viral entry, to cells expressing either or both ACE2 isoforms.",9,9,1,0.6081305

Notably, these specimens had not previously been tested for SARS-CoV-2.The RPN pools (n = 304) were prepared in an isolated class II biological safety cabinet at a separate location from the Clinical Microbiology and research labs that had never been used for handling respiratory specimens or viruses.Briefly, 400 microL of viral transport medium from each specimen was manually aliquoted one at a time into a sterile 5 mL snap-cap centrifuge tube (ASi, C2520).Once each specimen was aliquoted, the 4 mL volume was mixed manually by pipetting and 600 muL aliquots were reserved for SARS-CoV-2 NAAT.",10,20,0,0.53747314
