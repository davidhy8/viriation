86,86,"Relative Mutant N501Y SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein RBD Inhibition of Anti-Spike Protein IgG and ACE-2 Binding to Spike Protein SpeciesThe coronavirus disease outbreak of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a newly emerging coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected more than 110 million people worldwide, resulting in more than 2.4 million deaths (500,000 in the U.S.), little more than 1 year after initial cases appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.It has now become apparent that neutralizing antibodies specific for the viral spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), which binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor on host cells, comprise the critical element of protective immunity to the virus (2).This contention is supported by the finding that the RBD is immunodominant and the target of 90% of the neutralizing activity present in SARS-CoV-2 immune sera (3).The BNT162b2 mRNA and mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, both coding for the spike glycoprotein, developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, respectively, elicit antibodies specific for the RBD and exhibit approximately 95% protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection (4-6).Several mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains have raised concerns regarding increased transmissibility, lethality, and escape from extant immunity, relative to the predominant pandemic strain, D614G, itself a mutant that arose soon after viral spread from Wuhan, China.Most notable of these mutant strains are B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1, which arose in the U.K., South Africa and Brazil, respectively, during late 2020 to early 2021(7-11).The South African variant is of concern, with 21 mutations, including 3 in the RBD, since it has been shown to exhibit reduced neutralization titers, not only against therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, but also COVID-19 convalescent and post-vaccination plasma samples (10-13).Recently, it has been confirmed that these reductions of neutralizing antibody function were sufficient to impair vaccine efficacy appreciably (14).Common to all of the three major variant strains is the RBD mutation N501Y, which signifies a substitution of L-tyrosine for L-asparagine at residue 501 of the spike protein.",1,1

After the blocking step, all incubations were followed by three washes with 0.02 M phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 with 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T).Test wells were coated with 5 µg recombinant spike protein (rSP; S1+S2; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN)/ml coating buffer (0.05 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6) overnight at 4° C. Well contents were aspirated and all wells (including background wells for each sample and standard dilution) were blocked for 1 hour with conjugate buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in 0.05 M Tris, pH 8.0, with 0.02% sodium azide).Human anti-SP IgG standards (chimera, GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) or human ACE-2 Fc (chimera, R&D Systems) in serial dilutions of 500-31.3 ng/ml PBS-T were incubated (n = 6) for 2 hours.All wells were then incubated with 3,000-fold diluted goat anti-human IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 1 hour.The assay was developed by adding substrate buffer (0.05 M glycine buffer, pH 10.5, with 1.5 mM magnesium chloride) to each well, followed by 4 mg paranitrophenylphosphate (PNPP)/ml substrate buffer (for a total volume of 100 µl/well) and incubating for 15 minutes.",1,2

After blocking, 0.5 µg RBD-mFc (GenScript)/ml PBS-T was added to all wells and incubated for 2 hours.Human anti-SP IgG standards (in serial dilutions of 500-31.3 ng/ml PBS-T; n = 6) or human ACE-2 Fc (200-25 ng/ml; n = 3) were incubated for 1 hour.The rest of the ELISA protocol was the same as the rSP ELISA.The ODs of PBS-T only wells run in each assay were subtracted from test well ODs.Calculations of standards and sample antibody concentrations, as well as binding affinities, were performed as for the rSP ELISA.A correction nomogram for this ELISA is reproduced in Figure 1B.Human anti-SP IgG or ACE-2 Fc was mixed with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD His tag (R&D Systems) or recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (N501Y)-His tag (Sino Biological, Wayne, PA), both comprising R319-F541 (MW 26 kDa), to produce serial dilutions of 0-500 ng/ml of RBD in the presence of 25 ng/ml of antibody standard for primary incubation following the blocking step of the rSP ELISA.Serial dilutions of 0-250 ng/ml of RBD in the presence of 250 ng/ml of ACE-2 Fc were utilized for secondary incubation of the RBD ELISA.",0,3

90,90,"Inhibition curves of the anti-SP IgG chimera standard binding to the wild type spike protein (S1 + S2) in the rSP ELISA by the wild type RBD and the N501Y RBD (Fig.3B) were parallel, but different (all points, p < 0.05).The IC50 of the former was 20.8 nM, while that of the latter was 13.1 nM, indicating that the affinity of antibody binding to the N501Y RBD was actually nearly twice as great as to the wild type RBD.These data demonstrate that a) the Y501 spike protein does not have greater affinity for the ACE-2 receptor protein than the N501 SP; b) the Y501 spike protein may have an even greater affinity for a human monoclonal antibody specific for the wild type SP than the N501 SP; and c) recombinant RBD inhibition of ligand binding to immobilized spike protein or RBD is a valid approach to assessing the relevant molecular impact of viral mutations.Although there is ample evidence that the B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variant is more transmissible and less reactive with convalescent, post-vaccination, and therapeutic monoclonal neutralizing IgG antibodies than the predominant D614G pandemic strain, it is not at all clear what role the N501Y mutation plays in that shift.Most of the studies showing impaired antibody reactivity involved neutralization of whole virus infectivity in vitro.Neutralization of pseudoviruses engineered to express only the N501 or Y501 residues by 20 post-BNT162b2 vaccination sera was equivalent (6).Pseudoviruses engineered to express the K417N, E484K, N501Y and D614G residues, and to express the full B.1.351 mutations exhibited a 2.7- and 6.4-fold reduction, respectively, in neutralizing titer when compared to a pseudovirus possessing the D614G mutation alone, but retained sufficient neutralizing activity to ensure probable vaccine protection (11).However, dramatic decreases in the efficacy of three COVID-19 vaccines against the South African SARS-CoV-2 variant have been reported (14).Recently, an immunoassay technique was used to measure 1.351 RBD binding to acute, convalescent and post-vaccination plasma IgG antibodies relative to the B1 (wild type) RBD (Edara et al.)(20).Antibody binding magnitude was expressed in arbitrary units relative to a standard provided by the immunoassay manufacturer.Apparently, the 1.351 RBD contained all the mutations, but it is unclear how the protein was produced.Utilizing this approach, these investigators found that antibody binding to the 1.351 RBD was 3-fold lower than to the B1 RBD, which corresponded to a 3.5-fold lower neutralizing titer.",1,5
91,91,"Apparently, the 1.351 RBD contained all the mutations, but it is unclear how the protein was produced.Utilizing this approach, these investigators found that antibody binding to the 1.351 RBD was 3-fold lower than to the B1 RBD, which corresponded to a 3.5-fold lower neutralizing titer.They concluded that this reduction was not sufficient to compromise the protective efficacy of the antibodies.Next to Edara et al., the study reported here is one of the first to reflect direct ligand binding of a mutant RBD, rather than interference with whole virus infectivity.Contrary to expectations, we found no significant difference for the affinity of N501 and Y501 RBD binding to the ACE-2 receptor protein, and the Y501 RBD exhibited nearly twice the affinity for a human monoclonal IgG antibody specific for the wild type RBD as the N501 RBD.It has been speculated that the hydrogen bond between the Y501 residue and the Y41 residue of the ACE-2 protein contributes to an enhanced binding affinity compared to the N501 residue (9, 15, 17, 18).The O-H··N hydrogen bond, however, is stronger than the O-H··O bond, as opposed to the weaker N-H··O bond (21) and, since the N501 residue donates a hydrogen bond to the ACE-2 G352 (17), it is probably the recipient of the hydrogen bond donated by the Y41 residue.On the other hand, the N501-Y41 hydrogen bond is clearly sub-optimally aligned and separated by 3.7 Å, while the N487-Y83 bond is 2.7 Å (15), but it is unlikely that the Y501 mutant residue would be more favorably aligned.In any case, the results of this study support the conclusion that the enhanced binding of the B.1.351 virion to the ACE-2 receptor and its decreased binding affinity for IgG antibodies elicited by the D614G pandemic strain are due to spike protein RBD conformational changes provoked by multiple mutations, rather than the effect of a single mutation.These findings may help to a) implicate the nature of how viral mutations can increase transmissibility and virulence; b) provide an experimental approach to understanding mechanisms of interference with protective immunity; and c) suggest strategies for elucidating these mechanisms.In conclusion, a method has been developed, utilizing validated ELISAs for quantitation of human IgG antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the SP receptor binding domain (RBD), to compare the binding affinities of mutant RBDs for both the ACE-2 receptor protein and human anti-SP IgG antibodies.",1,6

93,93,"Characterization of entry pathways, species-specific ACE2 residues determining entry, and antibody neutralization evasion of Omicron BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3 variantsSince the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) with enhanced transmissibility, ACE2 binding affinity and immune evasive properties have emerged, including the most recent Omicron VOCs.Currently, Omicron (B.1.1.529) is comprised of five main lineages designated BA.1 (and its sublineage BA.1.1), BA.2 (and its sublineage BA.2.12.1), BA.3, BA.4, and BA.5.BA.1 was first identified in November 2021 in Botswana, and it rapidly replaced the then dominant Delta (B.1.617.2) VOC to become globally prevalent due to its enhanced transmissibility and ability to evade antibody neutralization 1–6.By early 2022, an alarming rise of BA.2 was seen in several parts of the world, leading to the replacement of BA.1 and BA.1.1.In comparison to BA.1, BA.2 was demonstrated to have faster replication kinetics, enhanced fusogenicity, and greater pathogenicity in hamsters 7,8.BA.4 and BA.5 are two new lineages that are presently emerging in South Africa.The spike protein of Omicron variants bears an unprecedented degree of antigenic divergence with the highest number of substitutions compared to ancestral B.1 (Wuhan-Hu-1, and D614G) variants and earlier VOCs.",1,1
