44,44,"4b).We did not find any obvious induction of antiviral response-related genes in OB samples by transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, but downregulation of inflammatory response-related genes was observed (Supplementary Fig.S9a, b).Of particular note, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of downregulated transcripts and proteins in the OE showed that genes belonging to ""olfactory transduction"" were significantly enriched (Fig.4c).Among all 100 downregulated transcripts at 2 dpi, 36 encoded ORs (Fig.4d and Supplementary Fig.S6b), while among the 278 downregulated transcripts at 4 dpi, 97 encoded ORs (Supplementary Figs.S6b and S8d).Further qRT-PCR assays showed that 13 representative OR genes were significantly downregulated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig.4e), which may also be attributed to the observed olfactory dysfunction.We further analyzed the expression of other host cell factors that were reported to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cells.The results showed that Nrp1 was significantly downregulated at 2 dpi (Supplementary Fig.S10a), and slight downregulation of Bsg/CD147, Tmprss2, Furin, and Tfrc/transferrin receptor was also detected by RNA-seq analyses (Supplementary Fig.S10b-e).DiscussionIn the present study, we used an established mouse model to demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause olfactory dysfunction and anosmia, and this experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection is the cause of olfactory dysfunction and anosmia in COVID-19 patients.SARS-CoV-2-infected mice exhibited a damaged OE, immune cell infiltration, downregulated OR expression, and impaired olfactory function, largely mimicking the olfactory abnormalities of COVID-19 patients.Robust viral replication and direct antiviral responses were detected in the OE of the infected mice but not in the OB and other parts of the brain, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 mainly infected the OM in the hACE2 mouse model.A recent study also showed that the SARS-CoV-2 protein could be detected in the OE, but not in the OB, in a hamster model.One possible explanation for the absence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS is that virus infection and replication in OE can effectively activate IFN-dependent antiviral responses (Supplementary Fig.S7a, b), which is an effective barrier that prevents viral invasion into the CNS.In addition, the apoptosis of infected OSNs may contribute to the prevention of viral spread into the CNS after the rapid infection and destruction of the OE.Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 invaded brain tissues in K18-hACE2 mice, which expressed hACE2 under the cytokeratin 18 promoter.",0,10
45,45,"In addition, the apoptosis of infected OSNs may contribute to the prevention of viral spread into the CNS after the rapid infection and destruction of the OE.Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 invaded brain tissues in K18-hACE2 mice, which expressed hACE2 under the cytokeratin 18 promoter.These inconsistencies in SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes, including CNS tropism, in different mouse models may be attributed to the different expression profiles of human ACE2 as well as the experimental systems.Our results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 initially infects non-neuroepithelial cells, including sustentacular cells, Bowman's gland cells and microvillar cells, which are involved in OSN support, host immune response, electrolyte balance maintenance, and mucus secretion.Moreover, we observed various levels of damage in the OE after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including cilia desquamation, loss of surface microvilli, and substantial structural disorganization.In addition, our results showed a certain degree of cell apoptosis and inflammatory infiltration at both the cell and molecular levels following SARS-CoV-2 infection.All these data indicate that the damaged supporting non-neuroepithelial cells and inflammatory infiltration caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection contribute to the detrimental effects of the virus on olfactory function.Our results are supported by recent findings in mice and humans, showing that the non-neuroepithelial cells of the OE express high levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 at both the mRNA and protein levels.Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2-positive signals were also observed in HBCs and mOSNs of infected animals at 2 dpi and 4 dpi, respectively (Fig.2a, c), although we did not detect any hACE2 expression in these cells (Supplementary Fig.S4d).The underlying mechanism remains elusive, and an hACE2-independent route of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be considered.According to recent studies, some other host cell receptors were found to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection, including NRP1, CD147, and transferrin receptor.Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 contains a specific furin cleavage site in the spike protein and utilizes TMPRSS2 for further spike protein priming.In our study, we found that the Nrp1, Bsg/CD147, Tmprss2, Furin, and Tfrc/transferrin receptor were downregulated to varying degrees in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice at 2 dpi, as shown by RNA-seq analyses, but whether these proteins play critical roles in olfactory dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 infection in our animal model remains unknown and warrants extensive investigation.We observed that many ORs were significantly downregulated at 2 and 4 dpi, suggesting the occurrence of decreased olfaction after SARS-CoV-2 infection.",0,11
46,46,"Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 contains a specific furin cleavage site in the spike protein and utilizes TMPRSS2 for further spike protein priming.In our study, we found that the Nrp1, Bsg/CD147, Tmprss2, Furin, and Tfrc/transferrin receptor were downregulated to varying degrees in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice at 2 dpi, as shown by RNA-seq analyses, but whether these proteins play critical roles in olfactory dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 infection in our animal model remains unknown and warrants extensive investigation.We observed that many ORs were significantly downregulated at 2 and 4 dpi, suggesting the occurrence of decreased olfaction after SARS-CoV-2 infection.A recent study also showed that induction of antiviral type I interferon signaling in the mouse OE was associated with diminished odour discrimination and decreased RNA levels of ORs.These findings may support what we observed in this study: SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a significant interferon response and dramatic OR decrease simultaneously in the OE.We also observed that the levels of three odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), which are compact globular water-soluble proteins with ligand-binding capabilities and are thought to aid in the capture and transport of odorants to the ORs, significantly decreased at the protein level with OE infection.In addition, although no viral infection was observed in the OB, we detected some up/downregulated transcripts or proteins by transcriptomic and proteomic analyses.Notably, among all four proteins co-regulated at both the transcriptomic and proteomic levels, Rtp1 (receptor-transporting protein 1) was downregulated at both levels (Supplementary Table S1).This protein specifically promotes functional cell surface expression of ORs, suggesting that the inhibition of Rtp1 in OB may lead to downregulation of ORs.Therefore, OE damage, which is closely related to olfactory dysfunction, is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection of non-neuroepithelial cells and OSNs synergizes with the host antiviral immune responses.According to our results, the olfactory dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals was recoverable, as almost all animals recovered their normal sense of smell at 4 dpi.Additionally, studies focusing on COVID-19 patients with anosmia have shown that most of them recover from loss of smell within a few weeks or less, and only a small number of patients reported slow partial recovery over 1 to 3 months, indicating a potential mechanism of OE regeneration from injuries.The hACE2 mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection reproduces the clinical course and viral replication observed in COVID-19 patients, as it mimics the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the transient olfactory dysfunction observed in human individuals.The difference in the time span of viral infection and clearance between humans and mice reflected the inherent differences between the species.The OE undergoes lifelong regeneration and replacement depending on two populations of basal stem cells, namely, HBCs and GBCs.HBCs are mitotically quiescent under normal conditions and become activated and differentiate into other kinds of cells once OE damage occurs.Unlike HBCs, most GBCs are mitotically activated and are responsible for the regeneration of both neuronal and non-neuronal cells.",0,12
47,47,"HBCs are mitotically quiescent under normal conditions and become activated and differentiate into other kinds of cells once OE damage occurs.Unlike HBCs, most GBCs are mitotically activated and are responsible for the regeneration of both neuronal and non-neuronal cells.Indeed, we observed regeneration of the OE, as indicated by the significant proliferation and morphological change of HBCs, accompanied by the differentiation of stem cells into iOSNs, sustentacular cells and microvillar cells.In this way, the structural basis and function of the OE as well as olfactory function can be restored to normal in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals.Furthermore, it was indicated that the damage and apoptosis of OSNs are closely involved in their regeneration, and the occurrence of an inflammatory response also facilitates stem cell differentiation and OE regeneration.At the transcriptomic and proteomic levels, we observed upregulated ""regulation of neuron projection development"" genes/proteins at 2 and 4 dpi, implying the progression of a neuron projection over time from its formation to the mature structure.Interestingly, although there were many significantly downregulated ORs at 4 dpi, the mRNA levels of many ORs increased slightly compared with those at 2 dpi, indicating that OR expression tends to recover to normal levels.In summary, our study established a mouse model of olfactory dysfunction induced by SARS-CoV-2.Considering the interspecies discrepancy in olfactory construction between rodents and humans, e.g., the relative size of the OB to the brain, the proportion of the brain involved in olfaction, and the expression of ORs, further studies are recommended to reproduce SARS-CoV-2-induced olfactory dysfunction in other animal models, especially nonhuman primates.Additionally, validating the targets and biological effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human specimens should still be considered.An animal model of olfactory disorders is available to subsequently evaluate antiviral drugs as well as vaccines for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 and for the improvement of post viral olfactory disorders.Materials and MethodsCell and virusVero cells were maintained at 37  C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 10 mM HEPES, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.The SARS-CoV-2 strain BetaCoV/Beijing/IMEBJ05/2020 (No.GWHACBB01000000) was originally isolated from a COVID-19 patient.For virus propagation, Vero cells were incubated with SARS-CoV-2, and the culture supernatants were collected at 3 dpi.The stock of SARS-CoV-2 was serially diluted and titrated on monolayers of Vero cells.",0,13
