Next, 3 contiguous overlapping fragments were fused by a first overlap PCR (step 2) using the utmost external primers of each set, resulting in 3 larger fragments with overlapping sequences.A final overlap PCR (step 3) was performed on the 3 large fragments using the utmost external primers to amplify the full-length S gene and the flanking sequences including the restriction sites KpnI and NotI.This fragment was digested and cloned into the expression plasmid phCMV1.For all PCR reactions the Q5 Hot Start High fidelity DNA polymerase was used (New England Biolabs Inc.), according to the manufacturer’s instructions and adapting the elongation time to the size of the amplicon.After each PCR step the amplified regions were separated on agarose gel and purified using Illustra GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (Merck KGaA).Ab discovery and recombinant expressionHuman mAbs were isolated from plasma cells or memory B cells of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 immune donors.Recombinant antibodies were expressed in ExpiCHO cells at 37°C and 8% CO2.Cells were transfected using ExpiFectamine.Transfected cells were supplemented 1 day after transfection with ExpiCHO Feed and ExpiFectamine CHO Enhancer.Cell culture supernatant was collected eight days after transfection and filtered through a 0.2 μm filter.Recombinant antibodies were affinity purified on an ÄKTA xpress FPLC device using 5 mL HiTrap MabSelect PrismA columns followed by buffer exchange to Histidine buffer (20 mM Histidine, 8% sucrose, pH 6) using HiPrep 26/10 desalting columns.Pseudovirus neutralization assay for testing NTD monoclonal antibodiesMLV-based SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein-pseudotyped viruses were prepared as previously described.",0,31

Pseudovirus with serial dilution of mAbs was incubated for 1 h at 37°C and then added to the wells after washing 2 times with DMEM.After 2–3 h DMEM containing 20% FBS and 2% penicillin–streptomycin was added to the cells.Following 48-72 h of infection, Bio-Glo (Promega) was added to the cells and incubated in the dark for 15 min before reading luminescence with Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek).Measurements were done in duplicate and relative luciferase units were converted to percent neutralization and plotted with a non-linear regression model to determine IC50 values using GraphPad PRISM software (version 9.0.0).Neutralization assaysMeasurements were done in duplicate and relative luciferase units were converted to percent neutralization against no-drug control which was set as 100%.Data were plotted with a non-linear regression model to determine IC50 values using GraphPad PRISM software (version 9.0.0).The 50% inhibitory dilution (EC50) was defined as the serum dilution at which the relative light units (RLUs) were reduced by 50% compared with the virus control wells (virus + cells) after subtraction of the background RLUs in the control groups with cells only.The EC50 values were calculated with non-linear regression, log (inhibitor) versus normalized response using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).The neutralization assay was positive if the serum achieved at least 50% inhibition at 1 in 3 dilution of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped virus in the neutralization assay.The neutralization result was negative if it failed to achieve 50% inhibition at 1 in 3 dilution.",0,32
