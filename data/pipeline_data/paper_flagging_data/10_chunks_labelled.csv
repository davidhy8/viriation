105,105,"Altogether, the spike substitutions in the BA.1, BA.2, BA.3 and BA.1.1 Omicron variants permit robust usage of diverse ACE2 orthologues for entry and thus have the potential to broaden the risk of the Omicron variants to infect animal species and spill back to humans.Despite several amino acids differences in the spikes of the BA.1, BA.2, BA.3 and BA.1.1 variants, three immunizations with the Pfizer/BNT162b2 vaccine elicited high and comparable levels of neutralizing antibodies against BA.1, BA.2, BA.3 and BA.1.1 pseudoviruses, at least for the short term.Since three-dose mRNA vaccine-induced antibodies elicited robust neutralizing antibodies and was shown to protect against severe disease against the BA.1 VOC 1, this protection likely extends to emerging BA.2 VOCs.These findings are consistent with several recent studies highlighting enhanced breadth and potency of three dose mRNA vaccine-induced antibody response against Omicron VOCs 1,3,9–14.Cross neutralizing antibodies against Omicron were observed post vaccine boost, but not post 2nd vaccination 1, suggesting recalled memory B cell or de novo induction of novel B cell clones that permit cross neutralization 15,16.Breakthrough infections with the BA.1 VOC after three vaccinations induced high neutralization titers against all Omicron variant pseudoviruses, as was the case for after three doses of the Pfizer/BNT162b2 vaccine without breakthrough infection.Comparable marked enhancement of serum-neutralizing activity between three dose-vaccinated subjects, vaccine breakthrough, and infected/vaccinated cases was reported in an earlier study where the number of exposures and/or time period between exposures to SARS-CoV-2, either via vaccination or infection, correlated with the strength of neutralizing antibody responses, as well as resilience to variants 10.Furthermore, our findings extend a recent report where sera from vaccinated individuals with confirmed Omicron breakthrough infection showed higher neutralization titers compared to vaccinated individuals without breakthrough infection 60.Altogether, findings from us and the others suggest that breakthrough infections can boost preexisting immunity induced by three doses of the Pfizer/BNT162b2 vaccine, thereby eliciting antibodies that neutralize not only Omicron and B.1 variants, but also Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants 60.Finally, a recent study used homologous hamster sera and antigenic cartography to visualize antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, demonstrating distinct antigenicity of BA.1 and BA.2 VOCs, separate from ancestral and earlier SARS-CoV-2 VOCs 61.Our study has several caveats, including the use of pseudoviruses instead of authentic SARS-CoV-2 for conducting experiments.However, our findings using pseudoviruses agree with those reported using authentic SARS-CoV-2.For instance, authentic BA.1/BA.1.1 VOCs were shown to undergo attenuated replication in TMPRSS2-expressing cells compared to ancestral Wuhan-Hu-1, and Alpha, Beta, and Delta VOCs 6,36.These reports also showed greater sensitivity of BA.1 pseudovirus entry to endosomal inhibitor E64d.While we used pseudovirus entry assays to determine Omicron variant usage of ACE2 receptors of various animal species, it remains unknown whether there may be intrinsic and/or innate host-specific factors that might act to inhibit live Omicron VOCs at an entry or post entry step.",0,13

111,111,"A prospective observational study for justification, safety, and efficacy of a third dose of mRNA vaccine in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysisThe level of protection achieved by the standard two doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) remains unclear.To study this we used the French Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (REIN) Registry to compare the incidence and severity of 1474 cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in patients receiving MHD after none, one or two doses of vaccine.Vaccination significantly reduce COVID-19 incidence and severity, but 11% of patients infected after two doses still died.Lack of vaccinal protection in patients naive for SARS-CoV-2 could be due to defective Tfh response [38% of patients with negative spike-specific CD4+ T-cell interferon gamma release assay] and failure to generate viral neutralizing titers of anti-spike receptor binding domain (RBD) IgGs (63% of patients with titer at or under 997 BAU/ml, defining low/no responders) after two doses of vaccine.To improve protection, a third dose of vaccine was administered to 75 patients [57 low/no responders, 18 high responders after two doses] from the ROMANOV cohort that prospectively enrolled patients receiving MHD vaccinated with BNT162b2 (Pfizer).Tolerance to the third dose was excellent.High responders to two doses did not generate more anti-RBD IgGs after three doses but had more side effects.Importantly, 31 (54%) of low/no responders to two doses reached neutralizing titers of anti-RBD IgGs after three doses.A positive interferon gamma release assay and/or suboptimal titer of anti-RBD IgGs after two doses were the only predictive variables for response to three doses in multivariate analysis.Thus, the standard scheme of vaccination insufficiently protects patients receiving MHD.Anti-RBD IgG and specific CD4+ T-cell response after two doses can guide personalized administration of the third dose, which improves the humoral response of SARS-CoV-2-naive patients receiving MHD.Graphical abstractAmong the various alarms raised by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was its impact on the population of patients with end-stage renal disease,   particularly those requiring in-center hemodialysis.",0,1
