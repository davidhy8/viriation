This will involve setting up your conda and pip environments and directories. In your case, you will also need to create a separate directory train at `data/train` so that you can save your training data for your models. You may use the following commands:\n",

    "# BERT\n",
    "\n",
    "The current PubMedBERT model is specifically trained to identify text chunks discussing SARS-CoV-2 mutations, so it will not flag texts reporting mutations from other viruses. To adapt the BERT model for your virus of interest, we recommend following the same procedure we used to train our PubMedBERT model, as outlined in `notebook/train.ipynb`. You can find detailed instructions [here](https://github.com/davidhy8/viriation/wiki/Model-Training-for-COVID%E2%80%9019).\n",
    "\n",
    "If a database of mutations is not available for your virus of interest, you may need to manually prepare data to train the BERT model. In our study on SARS-CoV-2, we used 300 positive and 300 negative examples of literature (publications, preprints, and grey literature) reporting SARS-CoV-2 mutations. We recommend preparing a similar amount of data for your virus if possible. If very few relevant publications are available for your virus, it may be useful to use our pre-trained SARS-CoV-2 model as a base model and fine-tune it with the limited data you have.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The second step in training the BERT model involves fine-tuning it with annotated text chunks, each containing 512 tokens. This process of data annotation is made easy with the notebook `notebook/dataset_labeller.ipynb`, which reads a dataframe containing columns for DOI and text (the full document) and splits the document into chunks for labeling in the command line. In the SARS-CoV-2 study, approximately 100 text chunks were annotate.\n"

While it might seem redundant to label and train on these text chunks now, instead of doing it in the first round, labeling all the text chunks for a large number of papers would have been too time-intensive and retraining the model along it's decision boundary is also very effective."
